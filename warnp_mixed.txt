BOOK ONE 1805





CHAPTER I

Well Prince so Genoa and Lucca are now just family estates of the
Buonapartes But I warn you if you dont tell me that this means war
if you still try to defend the infamies and horrors perpetrated by that
AntichristI really believe he is AntichristI will have nothing more to
do with you and you are no longer my friend no longer my faithful
slave as you call yourself But how do you do I see I have frightened
yousit down and tell me all the news

It was in July 1805 and the speaker was the wellknown Anna Pvlovna
Schrer maid of honor and favorite of the Empress Mrya Fdorovna With
these words she greeted Prince Vasli Kurgin a man of high rank and
importance who was the first to arrive at her reception Anna Pvlovna
had had a cough for some days She was as she said suffering from la
grippe grippe being then a new word in St Petersburg used only by the
elite

All her invitations without exception written in French and delivered
by a scarletliveried footman that morning ran as follows

If you have nothing better to do Count or Prince and if the
prospect of spending an evening with a poor invalid is not too terrible
I shall be very charmed to see you tonight between 7 and 10Annette
Schrer

Heavens what a virulent attack replied the prince not in the least
disconcerted by this reception He had just entered wearing an
embroidered court uniform knee breeches and shoes and had stars on
his breast and a serene expression on his flat face He spoke in that
refined French in which our grandfathers not only spoke but thought and
with the gentle patronizing intonation natural to a man of importance
who had grown old in society and at court He went up to Anna Pvlovna
kissed her hand presenting to her his bald scented and shining head
and complacently seated himself on the sofa

First of all dear friend tell me how you are Set your friends mind
at rest said he without altering his tone beneath the politeness and
affected sympathy of which indifference and even irony could be
discerned

Can one be well while suffering morally Can one be calm in times like
these if one has any feeling said Anna Pvlovna You are staying the
whole evening I hope

And the fete at the English ambassadors Today is Wednesday I must
put in an appearance there said the prince My daughter is coming for
me to take me there

I thought todays fete had been canceled I confess all these
festivities and fireworks are becoming wearisome

If they had known that you wished it the entertainment would have been
put off said the prince who like a woundup clock by force of habit
said things he did not even wish to be believed

Dont tease Well and what has been decided about Novosltsevs
dispatch You know everything

What can one say about it replied the prince in a cold listless
tone What has been decided They have decided that Buonaparte has
burnt his boats and I believe that we are ready to burn ours

Prince Vasli always spoke languidly like an actor repeating a stale
part Anna Pvlovna Schrer on the contrary despite her forty years
overflowed with animation and impulsiveness To be an enthusiast had
become her social vocation and sometimes even when she did not feel
like it she became enthusiastic in order not to disappoint the
expectations of those who knew her The subdued smile which though it
did not suit her faded features always played round her lips expressed
as in a spoiled child a continual consciousness of her charming defect
which she neither wished nor could nor considered it necessary to
correct

In the midst of a conversation on political matters Anna Pvlovna burst
out

Oh dont speak to me of Austria Perhaps I dont understand things
but Austria never has wished and does not wish for war She is
betraying us Russia alone must save Europe Our gracious sovereign
recognizes his high vocation and will be true to it That is the one
thing I have faith in Our good and wonderful sovereign has to perform
the noblest role on earth and he is so virtuous and noble that God will
not forsake him He will fulfill his vocation and crush the hydra of
revolution which has become more terrible than ever in the person of
this murderer and villain We alone must avenge the blood of the just
one Whom I ask you can we rely on England with her commercial
spirit will not and cannot understand the Emperor Alexanders loftiness
of soul She has refused to evacuate Malta She wanted to find and
still seeks some secret motive in our actions What answer did
Novosltsev get None The English have not understood and cannot
understand the selfabnegation of our Emperor who wants nothing for
himself but only desires the good of mankind And what have they
promised Nothing And what little they have promised they will not
perform Prussia has always declared that Buonaparte is invincible and
that all Europe is powerless before him And I dont believe a word
that Hardenburg says or Haugwitz either This famous Prussian
neutrality is just a trap I have faith only in God and the lofty
destiny of our adored monarch He will save Europe

She suddenly paused smiling at her own impetuosity

I think said the prince with a smile that if you had been sent
instead of our dear Wintzingerode you would have captured the King of
Prussias consent by assault You are so eloquent Will you give me a
cup of tea

In a moment propos she added becoming calm again I am expecting
two very interesting men tonight le Vicomte de Mortemart who is
connected with the Montmorencys through the Rohans one of the best
French families He is one of the genuine migrs the good ones And
also the Abb Morio Do you know that profound thinker He has been
received by the Emperor Had you heard

I shall be delighted to meet them said the prince But tell me he
added with studied carelessness as if it had only just occurred to him
though the question he was about to ask was the chief motive of his
visit is it true that the Dowager Empress wants Baron Funke to be
appointed first secretary at Vienna The baron by all accounts is a poor
creature

Prince Vasli wished to obtain this post for his son but others were
trying through the Dowager Empress Mrya Fdorovna to secure it for the
baron

Anna Pvlovna almost closed her eyes to indicate that neither she nor
anyone else had a right to criticize what the Empress desired or was
pleased with

Baron Funke has been recommended to the Dowager Empress by her sister
was all she said in a dry and mournful tone

As she named the Empress Anna Pvlovnas face suddenly assumed an
expression of profound and sincere devotion and respect mingled with
sadness and this occurred every time she mentioned her illustrious
patroness She added that Her Majesty had deigned to show Baron Funke
beaucoup destime and again her face clouded over with sadness

The prince was silent and looked indifferent But with the womanly and
courtierlike quickness and tact habitual to her Anna Pvlovna wished
both to rebuke him for daring to speak as he had done of a man
recommended to the Empress and at the same time to console him so she
said

Now about your family Do you know that since your daughter came out
everyone has been enraptured by her They say she is amazingly
beautiful

The prince bowed to signify his respect and gratitude

I often think she continued after a short pause drawing nearer to
the prince and smiling amiably at him as if to show that political and
social topics were ended and the time had come for intimate
conversationI often think how unfairly sometimes the joys of life are
distributed Why has fate given you two such splendid children I dont
speak of Anatole your youngest I dont like him she added in a tone
admitting of no rejoinder and raising her eyebrows Two such charming
children And really you appreciate them less than anyone and so you
dont deserve to have them

And she smiled her ecstatic smile

I cant help it said the prince Lavater would have said I lack the
bump of paternity

Dont joke I mean to have a serious talk with you Do you know I am
dissatisfied with your younger son Between ourselves and her face
assumed its melancholy expression he was mentioned at Her Majestys
and you were pitied

The prince answered nothing but she looked at him significantly
awaiting a reply He frowned

What would you have me do he said at last You know I did all a
father could for their education and they have both turned out fools
Hippolyte is at least a quiet fool but Anatole is an active one That
is the only difference between them He said this smiling in a way more
natural and animated than usual so that the wrinkles round his mouth
very clearly revealed something unexpectedly coarse and unpleasant

And why are children born to such men as you If you were not a father
there would be nothing I could reproach you with said Anna Pvlovna
looking up pensively

I am your faithful slave and to you alone I can confess that my
children are the bane of my life It is the cross I have to bear That
is how I explain it to myself It cant be helped

He said no more but expressed his resignation to cruel fate by a
gesture Anna Pvlovna meditated

Have you never thought of marrying your prodigal son Anatole she
asked They say old maids have a mania for matchmaking and though I
dont feel that weakness in myself as yet I know a little person who is
very unhappy with her father She is a relation of yours Princess Mary
Bolknskaya

Prince Vasli did not reply though with the quickness of memory and
perception befitting a man of the world he indicated by a movement of
the head that he was considering this information

Do you know he said at last evidently unable to check the sad
current of his thoughts that Anatole is costing me forty thousand
rubles a year And he went on after a pause what will it be in five
years if he goes on like this Presently he added Thats what we
fathers have to put up with Is this princess of yours rich

Her father is very rich and stingy He lives in the country He is the
wellknown Prince Bolknski who had to retire from the army under the
late Emperor and was nicknamed the King of Prussia He is very clever
but eccentric and a bore The poor girl is very unhappy She has a
brother I think you know him he married Lise Meinen lately He is an
aidedecamp of Kutzovs and will be here tonight

Listen dear Annette said the prince suddenly taking Anna Pvlovnas
hand and for some reason drawing it downwards Arrange that affair for
me and I shall always be your most devoted slaveslafe with an f as a
village elder of mine writes in his reports She is rich and of good
family and thats all I want

And with the familiarity and easy grace peculiar to him he raised the
maid of honors hand to his lips kissed it and swung it to and fro as
he lay back in his armchair looking in another direction

Attendez said Anna Pvlovna reflecting Ill speak to Lise young
Bolknskis wife this very evening and perhaps the thing can be
arranged It shall be on your familys behalf that Ill start my
apprenticeship as old maid





CHAPTER II

Anna Pvlovnas drawing room was gradually filling The highest
Petersburg society was assembled there people differing widely in age
and character but alike in the social circle to which they belonged
Prince Vaslis daughter the beautiful Hlne came to take her father
to the ambassadors entertainment she wore a ball dress and her badge
as maid of honor The youthful little Princess Bolknskaya known as la
femme la plus sduisante de Ptersbourg was also there She had been
married during the previous winter and being pregnant did not go to any
large gatherings but only to small receptions Prince Vaslis son
Hippolyte had come with Mortemart whom he introduced The Abb Morio
and many others had also come

 The most fascinating woman in Petersburg

To each new arrival Anna Pvlovna said You have not yet seen my aunt
or You do not know my aunt and very gravely conducted him or her to a
little old lady wearing large bows of ribbon in her cap who had come
sailing in from another room as soon as the guests began to arrive and
slowly turning her eyes from the visitor to her aunt Anna Pvlovna
mentioned each ones name and then left them

Each visitor performed the ceremony of greeting this old aunt whom not
one of them knew not one of them wanted to know and not one of them
cared about Anna Pvlovna observed these greetings with mournful and
solemn interest and silent approval The aunt spoke to each of them in
the same words about their health and her own and the health of Her
Majesty who thank God was better today And each visitor though
politeness prevented his showing impatience left the old woman with a
sense of relief at having performed a vexatious duty and did not return
to her the whole evening

The young Princess Bolknskaya had brought some work in a gold
embroidered velvet bag Her pretty little upper lip on which a delicate
dark down was just perceptible was too short for her teeth but it
lifted all the more sweetly and was especially charming when she
occasionally drew it down to meet the lower lip As is always the case
with a thoroughly attractive woman her defectthe shortness of her
upper lip and her halfopen mouthseemed to be her own special and
peculiar form of beauty Everyone brightened at the sight of this pretty
young woman so soon to become a mother so full of life and health and
carrying her burden so lightly Old men and dull dispirited young ones
who looked at her after being in her company and talking to her a
little while felt as if they too were becoming like her full of life
and health All who talked to her and at each word saw her bright smile
and the constant gleam of her white teeth thought that they were in a
specially amiable mood that day

The little princess went round the table with quick short swaying
steps her workbag on her arm and gaily spreading out her dress sat
down on a sofa near the silver samovar as if all she was doing was a
pleasure to herself and to all around her I have brought my work
said she in French displaying her bag and addressing all present
Mind Annette I hope you have not played a wicked trick on me she
added turning to her hostess You wrote that it was to be quite a
small reception and just see how badly I am dressed And she spread
out her arms to show her shortwaisted lacetrimmed dainty gray dress
girdled with a broad ribbon just below the breast

Soyez tranquille Lise you will always be prettier than anyone else
replied Anna Pvlovna

You know said the princess in the same tone of voice and still in
French turning to a general my husband is deserting me He is going
to get himself killed Tell me what this wretched war is for she
added addressing Prince Vasli and without waiting for an answer she
turned to speak to his daughter the beautiful Hlne

What a delightful woman this little princess is said Prince Vasli to
Anna Pvlovna

One of the next arrivals was a stout heavily built young man with
closecropped hair spectacles the lightcolored breeches fashionable
at that time a very high ruffle and a brown dress coat This stout
young man was an illegitimate son of Count Bezkhov a wellknown
grandee of Catherines time who now lay dying in Moscow The young man
had not yet entered either the military or civil service as he had only
just returned from abroad where he had been educated and this was his
first appearance in society Anna Pvlovna greeted him with the nod she
accorded to the lowest hierarchy in her drawing room But in spite of
this lowestgrade greeting a look of anxiety and fear as at the sight
of something too large and unsuited to the place came over her face
when she saw Pierre enter Though he was certainly rather bigger than
the other men in the room her anxiety could only have reference to the
clever though shy but observant and natural expression which
distinguished him from everyone else in that drawing room

It is very good of you Monsieur Pierre to come and visit a poor
invalid said Anna Pvlovna exchanging an alarmed glance with her aunt
as she conducted him to her

Pierre murmured something unintelligible and continued to look round as
if in search of something On his way to the aunt he bowed to the little
princess with a pleased smile as to an intimate acquaintance

Anna Pvlovnas alarm was justified for Pierre turned away from the
aunt without waiting to hear her speech about Her Majestys health Anna
Pvlovna in dismay detained him with the words Do you know the Abb
Morio He is a most interesting man

Yes I have heard of his scheme for perpetual peace and it is very
interesting but hardly feasible

You think so rejoined Anna Pvlovna in order to say something and get
away to attend to her duties as hostess But Pierre now committed a
reverse act of impoliteness First he had left a lady before she had
finished speaking to him and now he continued to speak to another who
wished to get away With his head bent and his big feet spread apart
he began explaining his reasons for thinking the abbs plan chimerical

We will talk of it later said Anna Pvlovna with a smile

And having got rid of this young man who did not know how to behave she
resumed her duties as hostess and continued to listen and watch ready
to help at any point where the conversation might happen to flag As the
foreman of a spinning mill when he has set the hands to work goes
round and notices here a spindle that has stopped or there one that
creaks or makes more noise than it should and hastens to check the
machine or set it in proper motion so Anna Pvlovna moved about her
drawing room approaching now a silent now a toonoisy group and by a
word or slight rearrangement kept the conversational machine in steady
proper and regular motion But amid these cares her anxiety about
Pierre was evident She kept an anxious watch on him when he approached
the group round Mortemart to listen to what was being said there and
again when he passed to another group whose center was the abb

Pierre had been educated abroad and this reception at Anna Pvlovnas
was the first he had attended in Russia He knew that all the
intellectual lights of Petersburg were gathered there and like a child
in a toyshop did not know which way to look afraid of missing any
clever conversation that was to be heard Seeing the selfconfident and
refined expression on the faces of those present he was always expecting
to hear something very profound At last he came up to Morio Here the
conversation seemed interesting and he stood waiting for an opportunity
to express his own views as young people are fond of doing





CHAPTER III

Anna Pvlovnas reception was in full swing The spindles hummed
steadily and ceaselessly on all sides With the exception of the aunt
beside whom sat only one elderly lady who with her thin careworn face
was rather out of place in this brilliant society the whole company had
settled into three groups One chiefly masculine had formed round the
abb Another of young people was grouped round the beautiful Princess
Hlne Prince Vaslis daughter and the little Princess Bolknskaya
very pretty and rosy though rather too plump for her age The third
group was gathered round Mortemart and Anna Pvlovna

The vicomte was a nicelooking young man with soft features and polished
manners who evidently considered himself a celebrity but out of
politeness modestly placed himself at the disposal of the circle in
which he found himself Anna Pvlovna was obviously serving him up as a
treat to her guests As a clever matre dhtel serves up as a specially
choice delicacy a piece of meat that no one who had seen it in the
kitchen would have cared to eat so Anna Pvlovna served up to her
guests first the vicomte and then the abb as peculiarly choice
morsels The group about Mortemart immediately began discussing the
murder of the Duc dEnghien The vicomte said that the Duc dEnghien had
perished by his own magnanimity and that there were particular reasons
for Buonapartes hatred of him

Ah yes Do tell us all about it Vicomte said Anna Pvlovna with a
pleasant feeling that there was something la Louis XV in the sound of
that sentence Contez nous ela Vicomte

The vicomte bowed and smiled courteously in token of his willingness to
comply Anna Pvlovna arranged a group round him inviting everyone to
listen to his tale

The vicomte knew the duc personally whispered Anna Pvlovna to one of
the guests The vicomte is a wonderful raconteur said she to another
How evidently he belongs to the best society said she to a third and
the vicomte was served up to the company in the choicest and most
advantageous style like a wellgarnished joint of roast beef on a hot
dish

The vicomte wished to begin his story and gave a subtle smile

Come over here Hlne dear said Anna Pvlovna to the beautiful
young princess who was sitting some way off the center of another
group

The princess smiled She rose with the same unchanging smile with which
she had first entered the roomthe smile of a perfectly beautiful woman
With a slight rustle of her white dress trimmed with moss and ivy with
a gleam of white shoulders glossy hair and sparkling diamonds she
passed between the men who made way for her not looking at any of them
but smiling on all as if graciously allowing each the privilege of
admiring her beautiful figure and shapely shoulders back and
bosomwhich in the fashion of those days were very much exposedand she
seemed to bring the glamour of a ballroom with her as she moved toward
Anna Pvlovna Hlne was so lovely that not only did she not show any
trace of coquetry but on the contrary she even appeared shy of her
unquestionable and all too victorious beauty She seemed to wish but to
be unable to diminish its effect

How lovely said everyone who saw her and the vicomte lifted his
shoulders and dropped his eyes as if startled by something extraordinary
when she took her seat opposite and beamed upon him also with her
unchanging smile

Madame I doubt my ability before such an audience said he smilingly
inclining his head

The princess rested her bare round arm on a little table and considered
a reply unnecessary She smilingly waited All the time the story was
being told she sat upright glancing now at her beautiful round arm
altered in shape by its pressure on the table now at her still more
beautiful bosom on which she readjusted a diamond necklace From time
to time she smoothed the folds of her dress and whenever the story
produced an effect she glanced at Anna Pvlovna at once adopted just
the expression she saw on the maid of honors face and again relapsed
into her radiant smile

The little princess had also left the tea table and followed Hlne

Wait a moment Ill get my work Now then what are you thinking
of she went on turning to Prince Hippolyte Fetch me my workbag

There was a general movement as the princess smiling and talking
merrily to everyone at once sat down and gaily arranged herself in her
seat

Now I am all right she said and asking the vicomte to begin she
took up her work

Prince Hippolyte having brought the workbag joined the circle and
moving a chair close to hers seated himself beside her

Le charmant Hippolyte was surprising by his extraordinary resemblance to
his beautiful sister but yet more by the fact that in spite of this
resemblance he was exceedingly ugly His features were like his
sisters but while in her case everything was lit up by a joyous self
satisfied youthful and constant smile of animation and by the
wonderful classic beauty of her figure his face on the contrary was
dulled by imbecility and a constant expression of sullen self
confidence while his body was thin and weak His eyes nose and mouth
all seemed puckered into a vacant wearied grimace and his arms and
legs always fell into unnatural positions

Its not going to be a ghost story said he sitting down beside the
princess and hastily adjusting his lorgnette as if without this
instrument he could not begin to speak

Why no my dear fellow said the astonished narrator shrugging his
shoulders

Because I hate ghost stories said Prince Hippolyte in a tone which
showed that he only understood the meaning of his words after he had
uttered them

He spoke with such selfconfidence that his hearers could not be sure
whether what he said was very witty or very stupid He was dressed in a
darkgreen dress coat knee breeches of the color of cuisse de nymphe
effraye as he called it shoes and silk stockings

The vicomte told his tale very neatly It was an anecdote then current
to the effect that the Duc dEnghien had gone secretly to Paris to visit
Mademoiselle George that at her house he came upon Bonaparte who also
enjoyed the famous actress favors and that in his presence Napoleon
happened to fall into one of the fainting fits to which he was subject
and was thus at the ducs mercy The latter spared him and this
magnanimity Bonaparte subsequently repaid by death

The story was very pretty and interesting especially at the point where
the rivals suddenly recognized one another and the ladies looked
agitated

Charming said Anna Pvlovna with an inquiring glance at the little
princess

Charming whispered the little princess sticking the needle into her
work as if to testify that the interest and fascination of the story
prevented her from going on with it

The vicomte appreciated this silent praise and smiling gratefully
prepared to continue but just then Anna Pvlovna who had kept a
watchful eye on the young man who so alarmed her noticed that he was
talking too loudly and vehemently with the abb so she hurried to the
rescue Pierre had managed to start a conversation with the abb about
the balance of power and the latter evidently interested by the young
mans simpleminded eagerness was explaining his pet theory Both were
talking and listening too eagerly and too naturally which was why Anna
Pvlovna disapproved

The means are the balance of power in Europe and the rights of the
people the abb was saying It is only necessary for one powerful
nation like Russiabarbaric as she is said to beto place herself
disinterestedly at the head of an alliance having for its object the
maintenance of the balance of power of Europe and it would save the
world

But how are you to get that balance Pierre was beginning

At that moment Anna Pvlovna came up and looking severely at Pierre
asked the Italian how he stood Russian climate The Italians face
instantly changed and assumed an offensively affected sugary
expression evidently habitual to him when conversing with women

I am so enchanted by the brilliancy of the wit and culture of the
society more especially of the feminine society in which I have had
the honor of being received that I have not yet had time to think of
the climate said he

Not letting the abb and Pierre escape Anna Pvlovna the more
conveniently to keep them under observation brought them into the
larger circle





CHAPTER IV

Just then another visitor entered the drawing room Prince Andrew
Bolknski the little princess husband He was a very handsome young
man of medium height with firm clearcut features Everything about
him from his weary bored expression to his quiet measured step
offered a most striking contrast to his quiet little wife It was
evident that he not only knew everyone in the drawing room but had
found them to be so tiresome that it wearied him to look at or listen to
them And among all these faces that he found so tedious none seemed to
bore him so much as that of his pretty wife He turned away from her
with a grimace that distorted his handsome face kissed Anna Pvlovnas
hand and screwing up his eyes scanned the whole company

You are off to the war Prince said Anna Pvlovna

General Kutzov said Bolknski speaking French and stressing the
last syllable of the generals name like a Frenchman has been pleased
to take me as an aidedecamp

And Lise your wife

She will go to the country

Are you not ashamed to deprive us of your charming wife

Andr said his wife addressing her husband in the same coquettish
manner in which she spoke to other men the vicomte has been telling us
such a tale about Mademoiselle George and Buonaparte

Prince Andrew screwed up his eyes and turned away Pierre who from the
moment Prince Andrew entered the room had watched him with glad
affectionate eyes now came up and took his arm Before he looked round
Prince Andrew frowned again expressing his annoyance with whoever was
touching his arm but when he saw Pierres beaming face he gave him an
unexpectedly kind and pleasant smile

There now So you too are in the great world said he to Pierre

I knew you would be here replied Pierre I will come to supper with
you May I he added in a low voice so as not to disturb the vicomte
who was continuing his story

No impossible said Prince Andrew laughing and pressing Pierres
hand to show that there was no need to ask the question He wished to
say something more but at that moment Prince Vasli and his daughter
got up to go and the two young men rose to let them pass

You must excuse me dear Vicomte said Prince Vasli to the Frenchman
holding him down by the sleeve in a friendly way to prevent his rising
This unfortunate fete at the ambassadors deprives me of a pleasure
and obliges me to interrupt you I am very sorry to leave your
enchanting party said he turning to Anna Pvlovna

His daughter Princess Hlne passed between the chairs lightly
holding up the folds of her dress and the smile shone still more
radiantly on her beautiful face Pierre gazed at her with rapturous
almost frightened eyes as she passed him

Very lovely said Prince Andrew

Very said Pierre

In passing Prince Vasli seized Pierres hand and said to Anna Pvlovna
Educate this bear for me He has been staying with me a whole month and
this is the first time I have seen him in society Nothing is so
necessary for a young man as the society of clever women

Anna Pvlovna smiled and promised to take Pierre in hand She knew his
father to be a connection of Prince Vaslis The elderly lady who had
been sitting with the old aunt rose hurriedly and overtook Prince Vasli
in the anteroom All the affectation of interest she had assumed had
left her kindly and tearworn face and it now expressed only anxiety and
fear

How about my son Bors Prince said she hurrying after him into the
anteroom I cant remain any longer in Petersburg Tell me what news I
may take back to my poor boy

Although Prince Vasli listened reluctantly and not very politely to the
elderly lady even betraying some impatience she gave him an
ingratiating and appealing smile and took his hand that he might not go
away

What would it cost you to say a word to the Emperor and then he would
be transferred to the Guards at once said she

Believe me Princess I am ready to do all I can answered Prince
Vasli but it is difficult for me to ask the Emperor I should advise
you to appeal to Rumyntsev through Prince Goltsyn That would be the
best way

The elderly lady was a Princess Drubetskya belonging to one of the
best families in Russia but she was poor and having long been out of
society had lost her former influential connections She had now come to
Petersburg to procure an appointment in the Guards for her only son It
was in fact solely to meet Prince Vasli that she had obtained an
invitation to Anna Pvlovnas reception and had sat listening to the
vicomtes story Prince Vaslis words frightened her an embittered
look clouded her once handsome face but only for a moment then she
smiled again and clutched Prince Vaslis arm more tightly

Listen to me Prince said she I have never yet asked you for
anything and I never will again nor have I ever reminded you of my
fathers friendship for you but now I entreat you for Gods sake to do
this for my sonand I shall always regard you as a benefactor she
added hurriedly No dont be angry but promise I have asked Goltsyn
and he has refused Be the kindhearted man you always were she said
trying to smile though tears were in her eyes

Papa we shall be late said Princess Hlne turning her beautiful
head and looking over her classically molded shoulder as she stood
waiting by the door

Influence in society however is a capital which has to be economized
if it is to last Prince Vasli knew this and having once realized that
if he asked on behalf of all who begged of him he would soon be unable
to ask for himself he became chary of using his influence But in
Princess Drubetskyas case he felt after her second appeal something
like qualms of conscience She had reminded him of what was quite true
he had been indebted to her father for the first steps in his career
Moreover he could see by her manners that she was one of those
womenmostly motherswho having once made up their minds will not rest
until they have gained their end and are prepared if necessary to go on
insisting day after day and hour after hour and even to make scenes
This last consideration moved him

My dear Anna Mikhylovna said he with his usual familiarity and
weariness of tone it is almost impossible for me to do what you ask
but to prove my devotion to you and how I respect your fathers memory
I will do the impossibleyour son shall be transferred to the Guards
Here is my hand on it Are you satisfied

My dear benefactor This is what I expected from youI knew your
kindness He turned to go

Waitjust a word When he has been transferred to the Guards she
faltered You are on good terms with Michael Ilarinovich Kutzov
recommend Bors to him as adjutant Then I shall be at rest and
then

Prince Vasli smiled

No I wont promise that You dont know how Kutzov is pestered since
his appointment as Commander in Chief He told me himself that all the
Moscow ladies have conspired to give him all their sons as adjutants

No but do promise I wont let you go My dear benefactor

Papa said his beautiful daughter in the same tone as before we
shall be late

Well au revoir Goodbye You hear her

Then tomorrow you will speak to the Emperor

Certainly but about Kutzov I dont promise

Do promise do promise Vasli cried Anna Mikhylovna as he went
with the smile of a coquettish girl which at one time probably came
naturally to her but was now very illsuited to her careworn face

Apparently she had forgotten her age and by force of habit employed all
the old feminine arts But as soon as the prince had gone her face
resumed its former cold artificial expression She returned to the
group where the vicomte was still talking and again pretended to
listen while waiting till it would be time to leave Her task was
accomplished





CHAPTER V

And what do you think of this latest comedy the coronation at Milan
asked Anna Pvlovna and of the comedy of the people of Genoa and Lucca
laying their petitions before Monsieur Buonaparte and Monsieur
Buonaparte sitting on a throne and granting the petitions of the
nations Adorable It is enough to make ones head whirl It is as if
the whole world had gone crazy

Prince Andrew looked Anna Pvlovna straight in the face with a sarcastic
smile

Dieu me la donne gare qui la touche They say he was very fine
when he said that he remarked repeating the words in Italian Dio
mi lha dato Guai a chi la tocchi

 God has given it to me let him who touches it beware

I hope this will prove the last drop that will make the glass run
over Anna Pvlovna continued The sovereigns will not be able to
endure this man who is a menace to everything

The sovereigns I do not speak of Russia said the vicomte polite but
hopeless The sovereigns madame What have they done for Louis XVII
for the Queen or for Madame Elizabeth Nothing and he became more
animated And believe me they are reaping the reward of their betrayal
of the Bourbon cause The sovereigns Why they are sending ambassadors
to compliment the usurper

And sighing disdainfully he again changed his position

Prince Hippolyte who had been gazing at the vicomte for some time
through his lorgnette suddenly turned completely round toward the
little princess and having asked for a needle began tracing the Cond
coat of arms on the table He explained this to her with as much gravity
as if she had asked him to do it

Bton de gueules engrl de gueules dazurmaison Cond said he

The princess listened smiling

If Buonaparte remains on the throne of France a year longer the
vicomte continued with the air of a man who in a matter with which he
is better acquainted than anyone else does not listen to others but
follows the current of his own thoughts things will have gone too far
By intrigues violence exile and executions French societyI mean
good French societywill have been forever destroyed and then

He shrugged his shoulders and spread out his hands Pierre wished to
make a remark for the conversation interested him but Anna Pvlovna
who had him under observation interrupted

The Emperor Alexander said she with the melancholy which always
accompanied any reference of hers to the Imperial family has declared
that he will leave it to the French people themselves to choose their
own form of government and I believe that once free from the usurper
the whole nation will certainly throw itself into the arms of its
rightful king she concluded trying to be amiable to the royalist
emigrant

That is doubtful said Prince Andrew Monsieur le Vicomte quite
rightly supposes that matters have already gone too far I think it will
be difficult to return to the old regime

From what I have heard said Pierre blushing and breaking into the
conversation almost all the aristocracy has already gone over to
Bonapartes side

It is the Buonapartists who say that replied the vicomte without
looking at Pierre At the present time it is difficult to know the real
state of French public opinion

Bonaparte has said so remarked Prince Andrew with a sarcastic smile

It was evident that he did not like the vicomte and was aiming his
remarks at him though without looking at him

I showed them the path to glory but they did not follow it Prince
Andrew continued after a short silence again quoting Napoleons words
I opened my antechambers and they crowded in I do not know how far
he was justified in saying so

Not in the least replied the vicomte After the murder of the duc
even the most partial ceased to regard him as a hero If to some
people he went on turning to Anna Pvlovna he ever was a hero
after the murder of the duc there was one martyr more in heaven and one
hero less on earth

Before Anna Pvlovna and the others had time to smile their appreciation
of the vicomtes epigram Pierre again broke into the conversation and
though Anna Pvlovna felt sure he would say something inappropriate she
was unable to stop him

The execution of the Duc dEnghien declared Monsieur Pierre was a
political necessity and it seems to me that Napoleon showed greatness
of soul by not fearing to take on himself the whole responsibility of
that deed

Dieu Mon Dieu muttered Anna Pvlovna in a terrified whisper

What Monsieur Pierre Do you consider that assassination shows
greatness of soul said the little princess smiling and drawing her
work nearer to her

Oh Oh exclaimed several voices

Capital said Prince Hippolyte in English and began slapping his knee
with the palm of his hand

The vicomte merely shrugged his shoulders Pierre looked solemnly at his
audience over his spectacles and continued

I say so he continued desperately because the Bourbons fled from
the Revolution leaving the people to anarchy and Napoleon alone
understood the Revolution and quelled it and so for the general good
he could not stop short for the sake of one mans life

Wont you come over to the other table suggested Anna Pvlovna

But Pierre continued his speech without heeding her

No cried he becoming more and more eager Napoleon is great because
he rose superior to the Revolution suppressed its abuses preserved all
that was good in itequality of citizenship and freedom of speech and of
the pressand only for that reason did he obtain power

Yes if having obtained power without availing himself of it to commit
murder he had restored it to the rightful king I should have called him
a great man remarked the vicomte

He could not do that The people only gave him power that he might rid
them of the Bourbons and because they saw that he was a great man The
Revolution was a grand thing continued Monsieur Pierre betraying by
this desperate and provocative proposition his extreme youth and his
wish to express all that was in his mind

What Revolution and regicide a grand thing Well after that But
wont you come to this other table repeated Anna Pvlovna

Rousseaus Contrat Social said the vicomte with a tolerant smile

I am not speaking of regicide I am speaking about ideas

Yes ideas of robbery murder and regicide again interjected an
ironical voice

Those were extremes no doubt but they are not what is most important
What is important are the rights of man emancipation from prejudices
and equality of citizenship and all these ideas Napoleon has retained
in full force

Liberty and equality said the vicomte contemptuously as if at last
deciding seriously to prove to this youth how foolish his words were
highsounding words which have long been discredited Who does not love
liberty and equality Even our Saviour preached liberty and equality
Have people since the Revolution become happier On the contrary We
wanted liberty but Buonaparte has destroyed it

Prince Andrew kept looking with an amused smile from Pierre to the
vicomte and from the vicomte to their hostess In the first moment of
Pierres outburst Anna Pvlovna despite her social experience was
horrorstruck But when she saw that Pierres sacrilegious words had not
exasperated the vicomte and had convinced herself that it was
impossible to stop him she rallied her forces and joined the vicomte in
a vigorous attack on the orator

But my dear Monsieur Pierre said she how do you explain the fact
of a great man executing a ducor even an ordinary man whois innocent
and untried

I should like said the vicomte to ask how monsieur explains the
18th Brumaire was not that an imposture It was a swindle and not at
all like the conduct of a great man

And the prisoners he killed in Africa That was horrible said the
little princess shrugging her shoulders

Hes a low fellow say what you will remarked Prince Hippolyte

Pierre not knowing whom to answer looked at them all and smiled His
smile was unlike the halfsmile of other people When he smiled his
grave even rather gloomy look was instantaneously replaced by
anothera childlike kindly even rather silly look which seemed to ask
forgiveness

The vicomte who was meeting him for the first time saw clearly that this
young Jacobin was not so terrible as his words suggested All were
silent

How do you expect him to answer you all at once said Prince Andrew
Besides in the actions of a statesman one has to distinguish between
his acts as a private person as a general and as an emperor So it
seems to me

Yes yes of course Pierre chimed in pleased at the arrival of this
reinforcement

One must admit continued Prince Andrew that Napoleon as a man was
great on the bridge of Arcola and in the hospital at Jaffa where he
gave his hand to the plaguestricken but but there are other acts
which it is difficult to justify

Prince Andrew who had evidently wished to tone down the awkwardness of
Pierres remarks rose and made a sign to his wife that it was time to
go

Suddenly Prince Hippolyte started up making signs to everyone to attend
and asking them all to be seated began

I was told a charming Moscow story today and must treat you to it
Excuse me VicomteI must tell it in Russian or the point will be
lost And Prince Hippolyte began to tell his story in such Russian
as a Frenchman would speak after spending about a year in Russia
Everyone waited so emphatically and eagerly did he demand their
attention to his story

There is in Moscow a lady une dame and she is very stingy She must
have two footmen behind her carriage and very big ones That was her
taste And she had a ladys maid also big She said

Here Prince Hippolyte paused evidently collecting his ideas with
difficulty

She said Oh yes She said Girl to the maid put on a livery
get up behind the carriage and come with me while I make some calls

Here Prince Hippolyte spluttered and burst out laughing long before his
audience which produced an effect unfavorable to the narrator Several
persons among them the elderly lady and Anna Pvlovna did however
smile

She went Suddenly there was a great wind The girl lost her hat and
her long hair came down Here he could contain himself no longer and
went on between gasps of laughter And the whole world knew

And so the anecdote ended Though it was unintelligible why he had told
it or why it had to be told in Russian still Anna Pvlovna and the
others appreciated Prince Hippolytes social tact in so agreeably ending
Pierres unpleasant and unamiable outburst After the anecdote the
conversation broke up into insignificant small talk about the last and
next balls about theatricals and who would meet whom and when and
where





CHAPTER VI

Having thanked Anna Pvlovna for her charming soiree the guests began
to take their leave

Pierre was ungainly Stout about the average height broad with huge
red hands he did not know as the saying is how to enter a drawing
room and still less how to leave one that is how to say something
particularly agreeable before going away Besides this he was absent
minded When he rose to go he took up instead of his own the generals
threecornered hat and held it pulling at the plume till the general
asked him to restore it All his absentmindedness and inability to
enter a room and converse in it was however redeemed by his kindly
simple and modest expression Anna Pvlovna turned toward him and with
a Christian mildness that expressed forgiveness of his indiscretion
nodded and said I hope to see you again but I also hope you will
change your opinions my dear Monsieur Pierre

When she said this he did not reply and only bowed but again everybody
saw his smile which said nothing unless perhaps Opinions are
opinions but you see what a capital goodnatured fellow I am And
everyone including Anna Pvlovna felt this

Prince Andrew had gone out into the hall and turning his shoulders to
the footman who was helping him on with his cloak listened
indifferently to his wifes chatter with Prince Hippolyte who had also
come into the hall Prince Hippolyte stood close to the pretty pregnant
princess and stared fixedly at her through his eyeglass

Go in Annette or you will catch cold said the little princess
taking leave of Anna Pvlovna It is settled she added in a low
voice

Anna Pvlovna had already managed to speak to Lise about the match she
contemplated between Anatole and the little princess sisterinlaw

I rely on you my dear said Anna Pvlovna also in a low tone Write
to her and let me know how her father looks at the matter Au revoir
and she left the hall

Prince Hippolyte approached the little princess and bending his face
close to her began to whisper something

Two footmen the princess and his own stood holding a shawl and a
cloak waiting for the conversation to finish They listened to the
French sentences which to them were meaningless with an air of
understanding but not wishing to appear to do so The princess as usual
spoke smilingly and listened with a laugh

I am very glad I did not go to the ambassadors said Prince Hippolyte
so dull It has been a delightful evening has it not Delightful

They say the ball will be very good replied the princess drawing up
her downy little lip All the pretty women in society will be there

Not all for you will not be there not all said Prince Hippolyte
smiling joyfully and snatching the shawl from the footman whom he even
pushed aside he began wrapping it round the princess Either from
awkwardness or intentionally no one could have said which after the
shawl had been adjusted he kept his arm around her for a long time as
though embracing her

Still smiling she gracefully moved away turning and glancing at her
husband Prince Andrews eyes were closed so weary and sleepy did he
seem

Are you ready he asked his wife looking past her

Prince Hippolyte hurriedly put on his cloak which in the latest fashion
reached to his very heels and stumbling in it ran out into the porch
following the princess whom a footman was helping into the carriage

Princesse au revoir cried he stumbling with his tongue as well as
with his feet

The princess picking up her dress was taking her seat in the dark
carriage her husband was adjusting his saber Prince Hippolyte under
pretense of helping was in everyones way

Allow me sir said Prince Andrew in Russian in a cold disagreeable
tone to Prince Hippolyte who was blocking his path

I am expecting you Pierre said the same voice but gently and
affectionately

The postilion started the carriage wheels rattled Prince Hippolyte
laughed spasmodically as he stood in the porch waiting for the vicomte
whom he had promised to take home

Well mon cher said the vicomte having seated himself beside
Hippolyte in the carriage your little princess is very nice very nice
indeed quite French and he kissed the tips of his fingers Hippolyte
burst out laughing

Do you know you are a terrible chap for all your innocent airs
continued the vicomte I pity the poor husband that little officer who
gives himself the airs of a monarch

Hippolyte spluttered again and amid his laughter said And you were
saying that the Russian ladies are not equal to the French One has to
know how to deal with them

Pierre reaching the house first went into Prince Andrews study like one
quite at home and from habit immediately lay down on the sofa took
from the shelf the first book that came to his hand it was Caesars
Commentaries and resting on his elbow began reading it in the middle

What have you done to Mlle Schrer She will be quite ill now said
Prince Andrew as he entered the study rubbing his small white hands

Pierre turned his whole body making the sofa creak He lifted his eager
face to Prince Andrew smiled and waved his hand

That abb is very interesting but he does not see the thing in the
right light In my opinion perpetual peace is possible butI do not
know how to express it not by a balance of political power

It was evident that Prince Andrew was not interested in such abstract
conversation

One cant everywhere say all one thinks mon cher Well have you at
last decided on anything Are you going to be a guardsman or a
diplomatist asked Prince Andrew after a momentary silence

Pierre sat up on the sofa with his legs tucked under him

Really I dont yet know I dont like either the one or the other

But you must decide on something Your father expects it

Pierre at the age of ten had been sent abroad with an abb as tutor and
had remained away till he was twenty When he returned to Moscow his
father dismissed the abb and said to the young man Now go to
Petersburg look round and choose your profession I will agree to
anything Here is a letter to Prince Vasli and here is money Write to
me all about it and I will help you in everything Pierre had already
been choosing a career for three months and had not decided on
anything It was about this choice that Prince Andrew was speaking
Pierre rubbed his forehead

But he must be a Freemason said he referring to the abb whom he had
met that evening

That is all nonsense Prince Andrew again interrupted him let us
talk business Have you been to the Horse Guards

No I have not but this is what I have been thinking and wanted to
tell you There is a war now against Napoleon If it were a war for
freedom I could understand it and should be the first to enter the army
but to help England and Austria against the greatest man in the world is
not right

Prince Andrew only shrugged his shoulders at Pierres childish words He
put on the air of one who finds it impossible to reply to such nonsense
but it would in fact have been difficult to give any other answer than
the one Prince Andrew gave to this nave question

If no one fought except on his own conviction there would be no wars
he said

And that would be splendid said Pierre

Prince Andrew smiled ironically

Very likely it would be splendid but it will never come about

Well why are you going to the war asked Pierre

What for I dont know I must Besides that I am going He paused
I am going because the life I am leading here does not suit me





CHAPTER VII

The rustle of a womans dress was heard in the next room Prince Andrew
shook himself as if waking up and his face assumed the look it had had
in Anna Pvlovnas drawing room Pierre removed his feet from the sofa
The princess came in She had changed her gown for a house dress as
fresh and elegant as the other Prince Andrew rose and politely placed a
chair for her

How is it she began as usual in French settling down briskly and
fussily in the easy chair how is it Annette never got married How
stupid you men all are not to have married her Excuse me for saying so
but you have no sense about women What an argumentative fellow you are
Monsieur Pierre

And I am still arguing with your husband I cant understand why he
wants to go to the war replied Pierre addressing the princess with
none of the embarrassment so commonly shown by young men in their
intercourse with young women

The princess started Evidently Pierres words touched her to the quick

Ah that is just what I tell him said she I dont understand it I
dont in the least understand why men cant live without wars How is it
that we women dont want anything of the kind dont need it Now you
shall judge between us I always tell him Here he is Uncles aidede
camp a most brilliant position He is so well known so much
appreciated by everyone The other day at the Aprksins I heard a lady
asking Is that the famous Prince Andrew I did indeed She laughed
He is so well received everywhere He might easily become aidedecamp
to the Emperor You know the Emperor spoke to him most graciously
Annette and I were speaking of how to arrange it What do you think

Pierre looked at his friend and noticing that he did not like the
conversation gave no reply

When are you starting he asked

Oh dont speak of his going dont I wont hear it spoken of said
the princess in the same petulantly playful tone in which she had spoken
to Hippolyte in the drawing room and which was so plainly illsuited to
the family circle of which Pierre was almost a member Today when I
remembered that all these delightful associations must be broken off
and then you know Andre she looked significantly at her husband
Im afraid Im afraid she whispered and a shudder ran down her
back

Her husband looked at her as if surprised to notice that someone besides
Pierre and himself was in the room and addressed her in a tone of
frigid politeness

What is it you are afraid of Lise I dont understand said he

There what egotists men all are all all egotists Just for a whim of
his own goodness only knows why he leaves me and locks me up alone in
the country

With my father and sister remember said Prince Andrew gently

Alone all the same without my friends And he expects me not to be
afraid

Her tone was now querulous and her lip drawn up giving her not a
joyful but an animal squirrellike expression She paused as if she
felt it indecorous to speak of her pregnancy before Pierre though the
gist of the matter lay in that

I still cant understand what you are afraid of said Prince Andrew
slowly not taking his eyes off his wife

The princess blushed and raised her arms with a gesture of despair

No Andrew I must say you have changed Oh how you have

Your doctor tells you to go to bed earlier said Prince Andrew You
had better go

The princess said nothing but suddenly her short downy lip quivered
Prince Andrew rose shrugged his shoulders and walked about the room

Pierre looked over his spectacles with nave surprise now at him and
now at her moved as if about to rise too but changed his mind

Why should I mind Monsieur Pierre being here exclaimed the little
princess suddenly her pretty face all at once distorted by a tearful
grimace I have long wanted to ask you Andrew why you have changed so
to me What have I done to you You are going to the war and have no
pity for me Why is it

Lise was all Prince Andrew said But that one word expressed an
entreaty a threat and above all conviction that she would herself
regret her words But she went on hurriedly

You treat me like an invalid or a child I see it all Did you behave
like that six months ago

Lise I beg you to desist said Prince Andrew still more emphatically

Pierre who had been growing more and more agitated as he listened to
all this rose and approached the princess He seemed unable to bear the
sight of tears and was ready to cry himself

Calm yourself Princess It seems so to you because I assure you I
myself have experienced and so because No excuse me An
outsider is out of place here No dont distress yourself Good
bye

Prince Andrew caught him by the hand

No wait Pierre The princess is too kind to wish to deprive me of the
pleasure of spending the evening with you

No he thinks only of himself muttered the princess without
restraining her angry tears

Lise said Prince Andrew dryly raising his voice to the pitch which
indicates that patience is exhausted

Suddenly the angry squirrellike expression of the princess pretty
face changed into a winning and piteous look of fear Her beautiful eyes
glanced askance at her husbands face and her own assumed the timid
deprecating expression of a dog when it rapidly but feebly wags its
drooping tail

Mon Dieu mon Dieu she muttered and lifting her dress with one hand
she went up to her husband and kissed him on the forehead

Good night Lise said he rising and courteously kissing her hand as
he would have done to a stranger





CHAPTER VIII

The friends were silent Neither cared to begin talking Pierre
continually glanced at Prince Andrew Prince Andrew rubbed his forehead
with his small hand

Let us go and have supper he said with a sigh going to the door

They entered the elegant newly decorated and luxurious dining room
Everything from the table napkins to the silver china and glass bore
that imprint of newness found in the households of the newly married
Halfway through supper Prince Andrew leaned his elbows on the table and
with a look of nervous agitation such as Pierre had never before seen on
his face began to talkas one who has long had something on his mind
and suddenly determines to speak out

Never never marry my dear fellow Thats my advice never marry till
you can say to yourself that you have done all you are capable of and
until you have ceased to love the woman of your choice and have seen her
plainly as she is or else you will make a cruel and irrevocable
mistake Marry when you are old and good for nothingor all that is good
and noble in you will be lost It will all be wasted on trifles Yes
Yes Yes Dont look at me with such surprise If you marry expecting
anything from yourself in the future you will feel at every step that
for you all is ended all is closed except the drawing room where you
will be ranged side by side with a court lackey and an idiot But
whats the good and he waved his arm

Pierre took off his spectacles which made his face seem different and
the goodnatured expression still more apparent and gazed at his friend
in amazement

My wife continued Prince Andrew is an excellent woman one of those
rare women with whom a mans honor is safe but O God what would I not
give now to be unmarried You are the first and only one to whom I
mention this because I like you

As he said this Prince Andrew was less than ever like that Bolknski who
had lolled in Anna Pvlovnas easy chairs and with halfclosed eyes had
uttered French phrases between his teeth Every muscle of his thin face
was now quivering with nervous excitement his eyes in which the fire
of life had seemed extinguished now flashed with brilliant light It
was evident that the more lifeless he seemed at ordinary times the more
impassioned he became in these moments of almost morbid irritation

You dont understand why I say this he continued but it is the
whole story of life You talk of Bonaparte and his career said he
though Pierre had not mentioned Bonaparte but Bonaparte when he
worked went step by step toward his goal He was free he had nothing
but his aim to consider and he reached it But tie yourself up with a
woman and like a chained convict you lose all freedom And all you
have of hope and strength merely weighs you down and torments you with
regret Drawing rooms gossip balls vanity and trivialitythese are
the enchanted circle I cannot escape from I am now going to the war
the greatest war there ever was and I know nothing and am fit for
nothing I am very amiable and have a caustic wit continued Prince
Andrew and at Anna Pvlovnas they listen to me And that stupid set
without whom my wife cannot exist and those women If you only knew
what those society women are and women in general My father is right
Selfish vain stupid trivial in everythingthats what women are when
you see them in their true colors When you meet them in society it
seems as if there were something in them but theres nothing nothing
nothing No dont marry my dear fellow dont marry concluded Prince
Andrew

It seems funny to me said Pierre that you you should consider
yourself incapable and your life a spoiled life You have everything
before you everything And you

He did not finish his sentence but his tone showed how highly he
thought of his friend and how much he expected of him in the future

How can he talk like that thought Pierre He considered his friend a
model of perfection because Prince Andrew possessed in the highest
degree just the very qualities Pierre lacked and which might be best
described as strength of will Pierre was always astonished at Prince
Andrews calm manner of treating everybody his extraordinary memory
his extensive reading he had read everything knew everything and had
an opinion about everything but above all at his capacity for work and
study And if Pierre was often struck by Andrews lack of capacity for
philosophical meditation to which he himself was particularly
addicted he regarded even this not as a defect but as a sign of
strength

Even in the best most friendly and simplest relations of life praise
and commendation are essential just as grease is necessary to wheels
that they may run smoothly

My part is played out said Prince Andrew Whats the use of talking
about me Let us talk about you he added after a silence smiling at
his reassuring thoughts

That smile was immediately reflected on Pierres face

But what is there to say about me said Pierre his face relaxing into
a careless merry smile What am I An illegitimate son He suddenly
blushed crimson and it was plain that he had made a great effort to say
this Without a name and without means And it really But he did
not say what it really was For the present I am free and am all
right Only I havent the least idea what I am to do I wanted to
consult you seriously

Prince Andrew looked kindly at him yet his glancefriendly and
affectionate as it wasexpressed a sense of his own superiority

I am fond of you especially as you are the one live man among our
whole set Yes youre all right Choose what you will its all the
same Youll be all right anywhere But look here give up visiting
those Kurgins and leading that sort of life It suits you so badlyall
this debauchery dissipation and the rest of it

What would you have my dear fellow answered Pierre shrugging his
shoulders Women my dear fellow women

I dont understand it replied Prince Andrew Women who are comme il
faut thats a different matter but the Kurgins set of women women
and wine I dont understand

Pierre was staying at Prince Vasli Kurgins and sharing the dissipated
life of his son Anatole the son whom they were planning to reform by
marrying him to Prince Andrews sister

Do you know said Pierre as if suddenly struck by a happy thought
seriously I have long been thinking of it Leading such a life I
cant decide or think properly about anything Ones head aches and one
spends all ones money He asked me for tonight but I wont go

You give me your word of honor not to go

On my honor





CHAPTER IX

It was past one oclock when Pierre left his friend It was a cloudless
northern summer night Pierre took an open cab intending to drive
straight home But the nearer he drew to the house the more he felt the
impossibility of going to sleep on such a night It was light enough to
see a long way in the deserted street and it seemed more like morning or
evening than night On the way Pierre remembered that Anatole Kurgin
was expecting the usual set for cards that evening after which there
was generally a drinking bout finishing with visits of a kind Pierre
was very fond of

I should like to go to Kurgins thought he

But he immediately recalled his promise to Prince Andrew not to go
there Then as happens to people of weak character he desired so
passionately once more to enjoy that dissipation he was so accustomed to
that he decided to go The thought immediately occurred to him that his
promise to Prince Andrew was of no account because before he gave it he
had already promised Prince Anatole to come to his gathering besides
thought he all such words of honor are conventional things with no
definite meaning especially if one considers that by tomorrow one may
be dead or something so extraordinary may happen to one that honor and
dishonor will be all the same Pierre often indulged in reflections of
this sort nullifying all his decisions and intentions He went to
Kurgins

Reaching the large house near the Horse Guards barracks in which
Anatole lived Pierre entered the lighted porch ascended the stairs
and went in at the open door There was no one in the anteroom empty
bottles cloaks and overshoes were lying about there was a smell of
alcohol and sounds of voices and shouting in the distance

Cards and supper were over but the visitors had not yet dispersed
Pierre threw off his cloak and entered the first room in which were the
remains of supper A footman thinking no one saw him was drinking on
the sly what was left in the glasses From the third room came sounds of
laughter the shouting of familiar voices the growling of a bear and
general commotion Some eight or nine young men were crowding anxiously
round an open window Three others were romping with a young bear one
pulling him by the chain and trying to set him at the others

I bet a hundred on Stevens shouted one

Mind no holding on cried another

I bet on Dlokhov cried a third Kurgin you part our hands

There leave Bruin alone heres a bet on

At one draught or he loses shouted a fourth

Jacob bring a bottle shouted the host a tall handsome fellow who
stood in the midst of the group without a coat and with his fine linen
shirt unfastened in front Wait a bit you fellows Here is Ptya
Good man cried he addressing Pierre

Another voice from a man of medium height with clear blue eyes
particularly striking among all these drunken voices by its sober ring
cried from the window Come here part the bets This was Dlokhov an
officer of the Semnov regiment a notorious gambler and duelist who
was living with Anatole Pierre smiled looking about him merrily

I dont understand Whats it all about

Wait a bit he is not drunk yet A bottle here said Anatole taking a
glass from the table he went up to Pierre

First of all you must drink

Pierre drank one glass after another looking from under his brows at
the tipsy guests who were again crowding round the window and listening
to their chatter Anatole kept on refilling Pierres glass while
explaining that Dlokhov was betting with Stevens an English naval
officer that he would drink a bottle of rum sitting on the outer ledge
of the third floor window with his legs hanging out

Go on you must drink it all said Anatole giving Pierre the last
glass or I wont let you go

No I wont said Pierre pushing Anatole aside and he went up to the
window

Dlokhov was holding the Englishmans hand and clearly and distinctly
repeating the terms of the bet addressing himself particularly to
Anatole and Pierre

Dlokhov was of medium height with curly hair and lightblue eyes He
was about twentyfive Like all infantry officers he wore no mustache
so that his mouth the most striking feature of his face was clearly
seen The lines of that mouth were remarkably finely curved The middle
of the upper lip formed a sharp wedge and closed firmly on the firm
lower one and something like two distinct smiles played continually
round the two corners of the mouth this together with the resolute
insolent intelligence of his eyes produced an effect which made it
impossible not to notice his face Dlokhov was a man of small means and
no connections Yet though Anatole spent tens of thousands of rubles
Dlokhov lived with him and had placed himself on such a footing that
all who knew them including Anatole himself respected him more than
they did Anatole Dlokhov could play all games and nearly always won
However much he drank he never lost his clearheadedness Both Kurgin
and Dlokhov were at that time notorious among the rakes and scapegraces
of Petersburg

The bottle of rum was brought The window frame which prevented anyone
from sitting on the outer sill was being forced out by two footmen who
were evidently flurried and intimidated by the directions and shouts of
the gentlemen around

Anatole with his swaggering air strode up to the window He wanted to
smash something Pushing away the footmen he tugged at the frame but
could not move it He smashed a pane

You have a try Hercules said he turning to Pierre

Pierre seized the crossbeam tugged and wrenched the oak frame out with
a crash

Take it right out or theyll think Im holding on said Dlokhov

Is the Englishman bragging Eh Is it all right said Anatole

Firstrate said Pierre looking at Dlokhov who with a bottle of rum
in his hand was approaching the window from which the light of the sky
the dawn merging with the afterglow of sunset was visible

Dlokhov the bottle of rum still in his hand jumped onto the window
sill Listen cried he standing there and addressing those in the
room All were silent

I bet fifty imperialshe spoke French that the Englishman might
understand him but he did not speak it very wellI bet fifty imperials
 or do you wish to make it a hundred added he addressing the
Englishman

No fifty replied the latter

All right Fifty imperials that I will drink a whole bottle of rum
without taking it from my mouth sitting outside the window on this
spot he stooped and pointed to the sloping ledge outside the window
and without holding on to anything Is that right

Quite right said the Englishman

Anatole turned to the Englishman and taking him by one of the buttons of
his coat and looking down at himthe Englishman was shortbegan
repeating the terms of the wager to him in English

Wait cried Dlokhov hammering with the bottle on the window sill to
attract attention Wait a bit Kurgin Listen If anyone else does the
same I will pay him a hundred imperials Do you understand

The Englishman nodded but gave no indication whether he intended to
accept this challenge or not Anatole did not release him and though he
kept nodding to show that he understood Anatole went on translating
Dlokhovs words into English A thin young lad an hussar of the Life
Guards who had been losing that evening climbed on the window sill
leaned over and looked down

Oh Oh Oh he muttered looking down from the window at the stones of
the pavement

Shut up cried Dlokhov pushing him away from the window The lad
jumped awkwardly back into the room tripping over his spurs

Placing the bottle on the window sill where he could reach it easily
Dlokhov climbed carefully and slowly through the window and lowered his
legs Pressing against both sides of the window he adjusted himself on
his seat lowered his hands moved a little to the right and then to the
left and took up the bottle Anatole brought two candles and placed
them on the window sill though it was already quite light Dlokhovs
back in his white shirt and his curly head were lit up from both
sides Everyone crowded to the window the Englishman in front Pierre
stood smiling but silent One man older than the others present
suddenly pushed forward with a scared and angry look and wanted to seize
hold of Dlokhovs shirt

I say this is folly Hell be killed said this more sensible man

Anatole stopped him

Dont touch him Youll startle him and then hell be killed Eh
What then Eh

Dlokhov turned round and again holding on with both hands arranged
himself on his seat

If anyone comes meddling again said he emitting the words separately
through his thin compressed lips I will throw him down there Now
then

Saying this he again turned round dropped his hands took the bottle
and lifted it to his lips threw back his head and raised his free hand
to balance himself One of the footmen who had stooped to pick up some
broken glass remained in that position without taking his eyes from the
window and from Dlokhovs back Anatole stood erect with staring eyes
The Englishman looked on sideways pursing up his lips The man who had
wished to stop the affair ran to a corner of the room and threw himself
on a sofa with his face to the wall Pierre hid his face from which a
faint smile forgot to fade though his features now expressed horror and
fear All were still Pierre took his hands from his eyes Dlokhov
still sat in the same position only his head was thrown further back
till his curly hair touched his shirt collar and the hand holding the
bottle was lifted higher and higher and trembled with the effort The
bottle was emptying perceptibly and rising still higher and his head
tilting yet further back Why is it so long thought Pierre It seemed
to him that more than half an hour had elapsed Suddenly Dlokhov made a
backward movement with his spine and his arm trembled nervously this
was sufficient to cause his whole body to slip as he sat on the sloping
ledge As he began slipping down his head and arm wavered still more
with the strain One hand moved as if to clutch the window sill but
refrained from touching it Pierre again covered his eyes and thought he
would never open them again Suddenly he was aware of a stir all around
He looked up Dlokhov was standing on the window sill with a pale but
radiant face

Its empty

He threw the bottle to the Englishman who caught it neatly Dlokhov
jumped down He smelt strongly of rum

Well done Fine fellow Theres a bet for you Devil take
you came from different sides

The Englishman took out his purse and began counting out the money
Dlokhov stood frowning and did not speak Pierre jumped upon the window
sill

Gentlemen who wishes to bet with me Ill do the same thing he
suddenly cried Even without a bet there Tell them to bring me a
bottle Ill do it Bring a bottle

Let him do it let him do it said Dlokhov smiling

What next Have you gone mad No one would let you Why you go
giddy even on a staircase exclaimed several voices

Ill drink it Lets have a bottle of rum shouted Pierre banging the
table with a determined and drunken gesture and preparing to climb out
of the window

They seized him by his arms but he was so strong that everyone who
touched him was sent flying

No youll never manage him that way said Anatole Wait a bit and
Ill get round him Listen Ill take your bet tomorrow but now we
are all going to s

Come on then cried Pierre Come on And well take Bruin with
us

And he caught the bear took it in his arms lifted it from the ground
and began dancing round the room with it





CHAPTER X

Prince Vasli kept the promise he had given to Princess Drubetskya who
had spoken to him on behalf of her only son Bors on the evening of Anna
Pvlovnas soiree The matter was mentioned to the Emperor an exception
made and Bors transferred into the regiment of Semnov Guards with the
rank of cornet He received however no appointment to Kutzovs staff
despite all Anna Mikhylovnas endeavors and entreaties Soon after Anna
Pvlovnas reception Anna Mikhylovna returned to Moscow and went
straight to her rich relations the Rostvs with whom she stayed when
in the town and where her darling Bry who had only just entered a
regiment of the line and was being at once transferred to the Guards as
a cornet had been educated from childhood and lived for years at a
time The Guards had already left Petersburg on the tenth of August and
her son who had remained in Moscow for his equipment was to join them
on the march to Radzivlov

It was St Natalias day and the name day of two of the Rostvsthe
mother and the youngest daughterboth named Nataly Ever since the
morning carriages with six horses had been coming and going
continually bringing visitors to the Countess Rostvas big house on
the Povarskya so well known to all Moscow The countess herself and
her handsome eldest daughter were in the drawing room with the visitors
who came to congratulate and who constantly succeeded one another in
relays

The countess was a woman of about fortyfive with a thin Oriental type
of face evidently worn out with childbearingshe had had twelve A
languor of motion and speech resulting from weakness gave her a
distinguished air which inspired respect Princess Anna Mikhylovna
Drubetskya who as a member of the household was also seated in the
drawing room helped to receive and entertain the visitors The young
people were in one of the inner rooms not considering it necessary to
take part in receiving the visitors The count met the guests and saw
them off inviting them all to dinner

I am very very grateful to you mon cher or ma chrehe called
everyone without exception and without the slightest variation in his
tone my dear whether they were above or below him in rankI thank
you for myself and for our two dear ones whose name day we are keeping
But mind you come to dinner or I shall be offended ma chre On behalf
of the whole family I beg you to come mon cher These words he
repeated to everyone without exception or variation and with the same
expression on his full cheerful cleanshaven face the same firm
pressure of the hand and the same quick repeated bows As soon as he
had seen a visitor off he returned to one of those who were still in the
drawing room drew a chair toward him or her and jauntily spreading out
his legs and putting his hands on his knees with the air of a man who
enjoys life and knows how to live he swayed to and fro with dignity
offered surmises about the weather or touched on questions of health
sometimes in Russian and sometimes in very bad but selfconfident
French then again like a man weary but unflinching in the fulfillment
of duty he rose to see some visitors off and stroking his scanty gray
hairs over his bald patch also asked them to dinner Sometimes on his
way back from the anteroom he would pass through the conservatory and
pantry into the large marble dining hall where tables were being set
out for eighty people and looking at the footmen who were bringing in
silver and china moving tables and unfolding damask table linen he
would call Dmtri Vaslevich a man of good family and the manager of
all his affairs and while looking with pleasure at the enormous table
would say Well Dmtri youll see that things are all as they should
be Thats right The great thing is the serving thats it And with a
complacent sigh he would return to the drawing room

Mrya Lvvna Kargina and her daughter announced the countess
gigantic footman in his bass voice entering the drawing room The
countess reflected a moment and took a pinch from a gold snuffbox with
her husbands portrait on it

Im quite worn out by these callers However Ill see her and no more
She is so affected Ask her in she said to the footman in a sad voice
as if saying Very well finish me off

A tall stout and proudlooking woman with a roundfaced smiling
daughter entered the drawing room their dresses rustling

Dear Countess what an age She has been laid up poor child at
the Razumvskis ball and Countess Aprksina I was so
delighted came the sounds of animated feminine voices interrupting
one another and mingling with the rustling of dresses and the scraping
of chairs Then one of those conversations began which last out until
at the first pause the guests rise with a rustle of dresses and say I
am so delighted Mammas health and Countess Aprksina and
then again rustling pass into the anteroom put on cloaks or mantles
and drive away The conversation was on the chief topic of the day the
illness of the wealthy and celebrated beau of Catherines day Count
Bezkhov and about his illegitimate son Pierre the one who had behaved
so improperly at Anna Pvlovnas reception

I am so sorry for the poor count said the visitor He is in such bad
health and now this vexation about his son is enough to kill him

What is that asked the countess as if she did not know what the
visitor alluded to though she had already heard about the cause of
Count Bezkhovs distress some fifteen times

Thats what comes of a modern education exclaimed the visitor It
seems that while he was abroad this young man was allowed to do as he
liked now in Petersburg I hear he has been doing such terrible things
that he has been expelled by the police

You dont say so replied the countess

He chose his friends badly interposed Anna Mikhylovna Prince
Vaslis son he and a certain Dlokhov have it is said been up to
heaven only knows what And they have had to suffer for it Dlokhov has
been degraded to the ranks and Bezkhovs son sent back to Moscow
Anatole Kurgins father managed somehow to get his sons affair hushed
up but even he was ordered out of Petersburg

But what have they been up to asked the countess

They are regular brigands especially Dlokhov replied the visitor
He is a son of Mrya Ivnovna Dlokhova such a worthy woman but
there just fancy Those three got hold of a bear somewhere put it in a
carriage and set off with it to visit some actresses The police tried
to interfere and what did the young men do They tied a policeman and
the bear back to back and put the bear into the Moyka Canal And there
was the bear swimming about with the policeman on his back

What a nice figure the policeman must have cut my dear shouted the
count dying with laughter

Oh how dreadful How can you laugh at it Count

Yet the ladies themselves could not help laughing

It was all they could do to rescue the poor man continued the
visitor And to think it is Cyril Vladmirovich Bezkhovs son who
amuses himself in this sensible manner And he was said to be so well
educated and clever This is all that his foreign education has done for
him I hope that here in Moscow no one will receive him in spite of his
money They wanted to introduce him to me but I quite declined I have
my daughters to consider

Why do you say this young man is so rich asked the countess turning
away from the girls who at once assumed an air of inattention His
children are all illegitimate I think Pierre also is illegitimate

The visitor made a gesture with her hand

I should think he has a score of them

Princess Anna Mikhylovna intervened in the conversation evidently
wishing to show her connections and knowledge of what went on in
society

The fact of the matter is said she significantly and also in a half
whisper everyone knows Count Cyrils reputation He has lost count
of his children but this Pierre was his favorite

How handsome the old man still was only a year ago remarked the
countess I have never seen a handsomer man

He is very much altered now said Anna Mikhylovna Well as I was
saying Prince Vasli is the next heir through his wife but the count
is very fond of Pierre looked after his education and wrote to the
Emperor about him so that in the case of his deathand he is so ill
that he may die at any moment and Dr Lorrain has come from
Petersburgno one knows who will inherit his immense fortune Pierre or
Prince Vasli Forty thousand serfs and millions of rubles I know it
all very well for Prince Vasli told me himself Besides Cyril
Vladmirovich is my mothers second cousin Hes also my Brys
godfather she added as if she attached no importance at all to the
fact

Prince Vasli arrived in Moscow yesterday I hear he has come on some
inspection business remarked the visitor

Yes but between ourselves said the princess that is a pretext The
fact is he has come to see Count Cyril Vladmirovich hearing how ill he
is

But do you know my dear that was a capital joke said the count and
seeing that the elder visitor was not listening he turned to the young
ladies I can just imagine what a funny figure that policeman cut

And as he waved his arms to impersonate the policeman his portly form
again shook with a deep ringing laugh the laugh of one who always eats
well and in particular drinks well So do come and dine with us he
said





CHAPTER XI

Silence ensued The countess looked at her callers smiling affably but
not concealing the fact that she would not be distressed if they now
rose and took their leave The visitors daughter was already smoothing
down her dress with an inquiring look at her mother when suddenly from
the next room were heard the footsteps of boys and girls running to the
door and the noise of a chair falling over and a girl of thirteen
hiding something in the folds of her short muslin frock darted in and
stopped short in the middle of the room It was evident that she had not
intended her flight to bring her so far Behind her in the doorway
appeared a student with a crimson coat collar an officer of the Guards
a girl of fifteen and a plump rosyfaced boy in a short jacket

The count jumped up and swaying from side to side spread his arms wide
and threw them round the little girl who had run in

Ah here she is he exclaimed laughing My pet whose name day it is
My dear pet

Ma chre there is a time for everything said the countess with
feigned severity You spoil her Ily she added turning to her
husband

How do you do my dear I wish you many happy returns of your name
day said the visitor What a charming child she added addressing
the mother

This blackeyed widemouthed girl not pretty but full of lifewith
childish bare shoulders which after her run heaved and shook her bodice
with black curls tossed backward thin bare arms little legs in lace
frilled drawers and feet in low slipperswas just at that charming age
when a girl is no longer a child though the child is not yet a young
woman Escaping from her father she ran to hide her flushed face in the
lace of her mothers mantillanot paying the least attention to her
severe remarkand began to laugh She laughed and in fragmentary
sentences tried to explain about a doll which she produced from the
folds of her frock

Do you see My doll Mimi You see was all Natsha managed
to utter to her everything seemed funny She leaned against her mother
and burst into such a loud ringing fit of laughter that even the prim
visitor could not help joining in

Now then go away and take your monstrosity with you said the mother
pushing away her daughter with pretended sternness and turning to the
visitor she added She is my youngest girl

Natsha raising her face for a moment from her mothers mantilla
glanced up at her through tears of laughter and again hid her face

The visitor compelled to look on at this family scene thought it
necessary to take some part in it

Tell me my dear said she to Natsha is Mimi a relation of yours A
daughter I suppose

Natsha did not like the visitors tone of condescension to childish
things She did not reply but looked at her seriously

Meanwhile the younger generation Bors the officer Anna Mikhylovnas
son Nicholas the undergraduate the counts eldest son Snya the
counts fifteenyearold niece and little Ptya his youngest boy had
all settled down in the drawing room and were obviously trying to
restrain within the bounds of decorum the excitement and mirth that
shone in all their faces Evidently in the back rooms from which they
had dashed out so impetuously the conversation had been more amusing
than the drawing room talk of society scandals the weather and
Countess Aprksina Now and then they glanced at one another hardly
able to suppress their laughter

The two young men the student and the officer friends from childhood
were of the same age and both handsome fellows though not alike Bors
was tall and fair and his calm and handsome face had regular delicate
features Nicholas was short with curly hair and an open expression
Dark hairs were already showing on his upper lip and his whole face
expressed impetuosity and enthusiasm Nicholas blushed when he entered
the drawing room He evidently tried to find something to say but
failed Bors on the contrary at once found his footing and related
quietly and humorously how he had known that doll Mimi when she was
still quite a young lady before her nose was broken how she had aged
during the five years he had known her and how her head had cracked
right across the skull Having said this he glanced at Natsha She
turned away from him and glanced at her younger brother who was
screwing up his eyes and shaking with suppressed laughter and unable to
control herself any longer she jumped up and rushed from the room as
fast as her nimble little feet would carry her Bors did not laugh

You were meaning to go out werent you Mamma Do you want the
carriage he asked his mother with a smile

Yes yes go and tell them to get it ready she answered returning
his smile

Bors quietly left the room and went in search of Natsha The plump boy
ran after them angrily as if vexed that their program had been
disturbed





CHAPTER XII

The only young people remaining in the drawing room not counting the
young lady visitor and the countess eldest daughter who was four years
older than her sister and behaved already like a grownup person were
Nicholas and Snya the niece Snya was a slender little brunette with
a tender look in her eyes which were veiled by long lashes thick black
plaits coiling twice round her head and a tawny tint in her complexion
and especially in the color of her slender but graceful and muscular
arms and neck By the grace of her movements by the softness and
flexibility of her small limbs and by a certain coyness and reserve of
manner she reminded one of a pretty halfgrown kitten which promises
to become a beautiful little cat She evidently considered it proper to
show an interest in the general conversation by smiling but in spite of
herself her eyes under their thick long lashes watched her cousin who
was going to join the army with such passionate girlish adoration that
her smile could not for a single instant impose upon anyone and it was
clear that the kitten had settled down only to spring up with more
energy and again play with her cousin as soon as they too could like
Natsha and Bors escape from the drawing room

Ah yes my dear said the count addressing the visitor and pointing
to Nicholas his friend Bors has become an officer and so for
friendships sake he is leaving the university and me his old father
and entering the military service my dear And there was a place and
everything waiting for him in the Archives Department Isnt that
friendship remarked the count in an inquiring tone

But they say that war has been declared replied the visitor

Theyve been saying so a long while said the count and theyll say
so again and again and that will be the end of it My dear theres
friendship for you he repeated Hes joining the hussars

The visitor not knowing what to say shook her head

Its not at all from friendship declared Nicholas flaring up and
turning away as if from a shameful aspersion It is not from friendship
at all I simply feel that the army is my vocation

He glanced at his cousin and the young lady visitor and they were both
regarding him with a smile of approbation

Schubert the colonel of the Pvlograd Hussars is dining with us
today He has been here on leave and is taking Nicholas back with him
It cant be helped said the count shrugging his shoulders and
speaking playfully of a matter that evidently distressed him

I have already told you Papa said his son that if you dont wish
to let me go Ill stay But I know I am no use anywhere except in the
army I am not a diplomat or a government clerkI dont know how to
hide what I feel As he spoke he kept glancing with the flirtatiousness
of a handsome youth at Snya and the young lady visitor

The little kitten feasting her eyes on him seemed ready at any moment
to start her gambols again and display her kittenish nature

All right all right said the old count He always flares up This
Buonaparte has turned all their heads they all think of how he rose
from an ensign and became Emperor Well well God grant it he added
not noticing his visitors sarcastic smile

The elders began talking about Bonaparte Julie Kargina turned to young
Rostv

What a pity you werent at the Arkhrovs on Thursday It was so dull
without you said she giving him a tender smile

The young man flattered sat down nearer to her with a coquettish
smile and engaged the smiling Julie in a confidential conversation
without at all noticing that his involuntary smile had stabbed the heart
of Snya who blushed and smiled unnaturally In the midst of his talk
he glanced round at her She gave him a passionately angry glance and
hardly able to restrain her tears and maintain the artificial smile on
her lips she got up and left the room All Nicholas animation
vanished He waited for the first pause in the conversation and then
with a distressed face left the room to find Snya

How plainly all these young people wear their hearts on their sleeves
said Anna Mikhylovna pointing to Nicholas as he went out
Cousinagedangereux voisinage she added

 Cousinhood is a dangerous neighborhood

Yes said the countess when the brightness these young people had
brought into the room had vanished and as if answering a question no
one had put but which was always in her mind and how much suffering
how much anxiety one has had to go through that we might rejoice in them
now And yet really the anxiety is greater now than the joy One is
always always anxious Especially just at this age so dangerous both
for girls and boys

It all depends on the bringing up remarked the visitor

Yes youre quite right continued the countess Till now I have
always thank God been my childrens friend and had their full
confidence said she repeating the mistake of so many parents who
imagine that their children have no secrets from them I know I shall
always be my daughters first confidante and that if Nicholas with his
impulsive nature does get into mischief a boy cant help it he will
all the same never be like those Petersburg young men

Yes they are splendid splendid youngsters chimed in the count who
always solved questions that seemed to him perplexing by deciding that
everything was splendid Just fancy wants to be an hussar Whats one
to do my dear

What a charming creature your younger girl is said the visitor a
little volcano

Yes a regular volcano said the count Takes after me And what a
voice she has though shes my daughter I tell the truth when I say
shell be a singer a second Salomoni We have engaged an Italian to
give her lessons

Isnt she too young I have heard that it harms the voice to train it
at that age

Oh no not at all too young replied the count Why our mothers used
to be married at twelve or thirteen

And shes in love with Bors already Just fancy said the countess
with a gentle smile looking at Bors and went on evidently concerned
with a thought that always occupied her Now you see if I were to be
severe with her and to forbid it goodness knows what they might be
up to on the sly she meant that they would be kissing but as it is
I know every word she utters She will come running to me of her own
accord in the evening and tell me everything Perhaps I spoil her but
really that seems the best plan With her elder sister I was stricter

Yes I was brought up quite differently remarked the handsome elder
daughter Countess Vra with a smile

But the smile did not enhance Vras beauty as smiles generally do on
the contrary it gave her an unnatural and therefore unpleasant
expression Vra was goodlooking not at all stupid quick at learning
was wellbrought up and had a pleasant voice what she said was true
and appropriate yet strange to say everyonethe visitors and countess
aliketurned to look at her as if wondering why she had said it and
they all felt awkward

People are always too clever with their eldest children and try to make
something exceptional of them said the visitor

Whats the good of denying it my dear Our dear countess was too
clever with Vra said the count Well what of that Shes turned out
splendidly all the same he added winking at Vra

The guests got up and took their leave promising to return to dinner

What manners I thought they would never go said the countess when
she had seen her guests out





CHAPTER XIII

When Natsha ran out of the drawing room she only went as far as the
conservatory There she paused and stood listening to the conversation
in the drawing room waiting for Bors to come out She was already
growing impatient and stamped her foot ready to cry at his not coming
at once when she heard the young mans discreet steps approaching
neither quickly nor slowly At this Natsha dashed swiftly among the
flower tubs and hid there

Bors paused in the middle of the room looked round brushed a little
dust from the sleeve of his uniform and going up to a mirror examined
his handsome face Natsha very still peered out from her ambush
waiting to see what he would do He stood a little while before the
glass smiled and walked toward the other door Natsha was about to
call him but changed her mind Let him look for me thought she
Hardly had Bors gone than Snya flushed in tears and muttering
angrily came in at the other door Natsha checked her first impulse to
run out to her and remained in her hiding place watchingas under an
invisible capto see what went on in the world She was experiencing a
new and peculiar pleasure Snya muttering to herself kept looking
round toward the drawing room door It opened and Nicholas came in

Snya what is the matter with you How can you said he running up
to her

Its nothing nothing leave me alone sobbed Snya

Ah I know what it is

Well if you do so much the better and you can go back to her

Soonya Look here How can you torture me and yourself like that
for a mere fancy said Nicholas taking her hand

Snya did not pull it away and left off crying Natsha not stirring
and scarcely breathing watched from her ambush with sparkling eyes
What will happen now thought she

Snya What is anyone in the world to me You alone are everything
said Nicholas And I will prove it to you

I dont like you to talk like that

Well then I wont only forgive me Snya He drew her to him and
kissed her

Oh how nice thought Natsha and when Snya and Nicholas had gone
out of the conservatory she followed and called Bors to her

Bors come here said she with a sly and significant look I have
something to tell you Here here and she led him into the
conservatory to the place among the tubs where she had been hiding

Bors followed her smiling

What is the something asked he

She grew confused glanced round and seeing the doll she had thrown
down on one of the tubs picked it up

Kiss the doll said she

Bors looked attentively and kindly at her eager face but did not
reply

Dont you want to Well then come here said she and went further
in among the plants and threw down the doll Closer closer she
whispered

She caught the young officer by his cuffs and a look of solemnity and
fear appeared on her flushed face

And me Would you like to kiss me she whispered almost inaudibly
glancing up at him from under her brows smiling and almost crying from
excitement

Bors blushed

How funny you are he said bending down to her and blushing still
more but he waited and did nothing

Suddenly she jumped up onto a tub to be higher than he embraced him so
that both her slender bare arms clasped him above his neck and tossing
back her hair kissed him full on the lips

Then she slipped down among the flowerpots on the other side of the tubs
and stood hanging her head

Natsha he said you know that I love you but

You are in love with me Natsha broke in

Yes I am but please dont let us do like that In another four
years then I will ask for your hand

Natsha considered

Thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen she counted on her slender
little fingers All right Then its settled

A smile of joy and satisfaction lit up her eager face

Settled replied Bors

Forever said the little girl Till death itself

She took his arm and with a happy face went with him into the adjoining
sitting room





CHAPTER XIV

After receiving her visitors the countess was so tired that she gave
orders to admit no more but the porter was told to be sure to invite to
dinner all who came to congratulate The countess wished to have a
ttette talk with the friend of her childhood Princess Anna
Mikhylovna whom she had not seen properly since she returned from
Petersburg Anna Mikhylovna with her tearworn but pleasant face drew
her chair nearer to that of the countess

With you I will be quite frank said Anna Mikhylovna There are not
many left of us old friends Thats why I so value your friendship

Anna Mikhylovna looked at Vra and paused The countess pressed her
friends hand

Vra she said to her eldest daughter who was evidently not a
favorite how is it you have so little tact Dont you see you are not
wanted here Go to the other girls or

The handsome Vra smiled contemptuously but did not seem at all hurt

If you had told me sooner Mamma I would have gone she replied as
she rose to go to her own room

But as she passed the sitting room she noticed two couples sitting one
pair at each window She stopped and smiled scornfully Snya was
sitting close to Nicholas who was copying out some verses for her the
first he had ever written Bors and Natsha were at the other window
and ceased talking when Vra entered Snya and Natsha looked at Vra
with guilty happy faces

It was pleasant and touching to see these little girls in love but
apparently the sight of them roused no pleasant feeling in Vra

How often have I asked you not to take my things she said You have
a room of your own and she took the inkstand from Nicholas

In a minute in a minute he said dipping his pen

You always manage to do things at the wrong time continued Vra You
came rushing into the drawing room so that everyone felt ashamed of
you

Though what she said was quite just perhaps for that very reason no one
replied and the four simply looked at one another She lingered in the
room with the inkstand in her hand

And at your age what secrets can there be between Natsha and Bors or
between you two Its all nonsense

Now Vra what does it matter to you said Natsha in defense
speaking very gently

She seemed that day to be more than ever kind and affectionate to
everyone

Very silly said Vra I am ashamed of you Secrets indeed

All have secrets of their own answered Natsha getting warmer We
dont interfere with you and Berg

I should think not said Vra because there can never be anything
wrong in my behavior But Ill just tell Mamma how you are behaving with
Bors

Natlya Ilynchna behaves very well to me remarked Bors I have
nothing to complain of

Dont Bors You are such a diplomat that it is really tiresome said
Natsha in a mortified voice that trembled slightly She used the word
diplomat which was just then much in vogue among the children in the
special sense they attached to it Why does she bother me And she
added turning to Vra Youll never understand it because youve
never loved anyone You have no heart You are a Madame de Genlis and
nothing more this nickname bestowed on Vra by Nicholas was
considered very stinging and your greatest pleasure is to be
unpleasant to people Go and flirt with Berg as much as you please she
finished quickly

I shall at any rate not run after a young man before visitors

Well now youve done what you wanted put in Nicholassaid
unpleasant things to everyone and upset them Lets go to the nursery

All four like a flock of scared birds got up and left the room

The unpleasant things were said to me remarked Vra I said none to
anyone

Madame de Genlis Madame de Genlis shouted laughing voices through
the door

The handsome Vra who produced such an irritating and unpleasant effect
on everyone smiled and evidently unmoved by what had been said to her
went to the looking glass and arranged her hair and scarf Looking at
her own handsome face she seemed to become still colder and calmer

In the drawing room the conversation was still going on

Ah my dear said the countess my life is not all roses either
Dont I know that at the rate we are living our means wont last long
Its all the Club and his easygoing nature Even in the country do we
get any rest Theatricals hunting and heaven knows what besides But
dont lets talk about me tell me how you managed everything I often
wonder at you Annettehow at your age you can rush off alone in a
carriage to Moscow to Petersburg to those ministers and great people
and know how to deal with them all Its quite astonishing How did you
get things settled I couldnt possibly do it

Ah my love answered Anna Mikhylovna God grant you never know what
it is to be left a widow without means and with a son you love to
distraction One learns many things then she added with a certain
pride That lawsuit taught me much When I want to see one of those big
people I write a note Princess SoandSo desires an interview with So
andSo and then I take a cab and go myself two three or four
timestill I get what I want I dont mind what they think of me

Well and to whom did you apply about Bry asked the countess You
see yours is already an officer in the Guards while my Nicholas is
going as a cadet Theres no one to interest himself for him To whom
did you apply

To Prince Vasli He was so kind He at once agreed to everything and
put the matter before the Emperor said Princess Anna Mikhylovna
enthusiastically quite forgetting all the humiliation she had endured
to gain her end

Has Prince Vasli aged much asked the countess I have not seen him
since we acted together at the Rumyntsovs theatricals I expect he has
forgotten me He paid me attentions in those days said the countess
with a smile

He is just the same as ever replied Anna Mikhylovna overflowing
with amiability His position has not turned his head at all He said to
me I am sorry I can do so little for you dear Princess I am at your
command Yes he is a fine fellow and a very kind relation But
Nataly you know my love for my son I would do anything for his
happiness And my affairs are in such a bad way that my position is now
a terrible one continued Anna Mikhylovna sadly dropping her voice
My wretched lawsuit takes all I have and makes no progress Would you
believe it I have literally not a penny and dont know how to equip
Bors She took out her handkerchief and began to cry I need five
hundred rubles and have only one twentyfiveruble note I am in such a
state My only hope now is in Count Cyril Vladmirovich Bezkhov If
he will not assist his godsonyou know he is Brys godfatherand allow
him something for his maintenance all my trouble will have been thrown
away I shall not be able to equip him

The countess eyes filled with tears and she pondered in silence

I often think though perhaps its a sin said the princess that
here lives Count Cyril Vladmirovich Bezkhov so rich all alone that
tremendous fortune and what is his life worth Its a burden to him
and Brys life is only just beginning

Surely he will leave something to Bors said the countess

Heaven only knows my dear These rich grandees are so selfish Still
I will take Bors and go to see him at once and I shall speak to him
straight out Let people think what they will of me its really all the
same to me when my sons fate is at stake The princess rose Its now
two oclock and you dine at four There will just be time

And like a practical Petersburg lady who knows how to make the most of
time Anna Mikhylovna sent someone to call her son and went into the
anteroom with him

Goodbye my dear said she to the countess who saw her to the door
and added in a whisper so that her son should not hear Wish me good
luck

Are you going to Count Cyril Vladmirovich my dear said the count
coming out from the dining hall into the anteroom and he added If he
is better ask Pierre to dine with us He has been to the house you
know and danced with the children Be sure to invite him my dear We
will see how Tars distinguishes himself today He says Count Orlv
never gave such a dinner as ours will be





CHAPTER XV

My dear Bors said Princess Anna Mikhylovna to her son as Countess
Rostvas carriage in which they were seated drove over the straw
covered street and turned into the wide courtyard of Count Cyril
Vladmirovich Bezkhovs house My dear Bors said the mother
drawing her hand from beneath her old mantle and laying it timidly and
tenderly on her sons arm be affectionate and attentive to him Count
Cyril Vladmirovich is your godfather after all your future depends on
him Remember that my dear and be nice to him as you so well know how
to be

If only I knew that anything besides humiliation would come of it
answered her son coldly But I have promised and will do it for your
sake

Although the hall porter saw someones carriage standing at the
entrance after scrutinizing the mother and son who without asking to
be announced had passed straight through the glass porch between the
rows of statues in niches and looking significantly at the ladys old
cloak he asked whether they wanted the count or the princesses and
hearing that they wished to see the count said his excellency was worse
today and that his excellency was not receiving anyone

We may as well go back said the son in French

My dear exclaimed his mother imploringly again laying her hand on
his arm as if that touch might soothe or rouse him

Bors said no more but looked inquiringly at his mother without taking
off his cloak

My friend said Anna Mikhylovna in gentle tones addressing the hall
porter I know Count Cyril Vladmirovich is very ill thats why I
have come I am a relation I shall not disturb him my friend I
only need see Prince Vasli Sergevich he is staying here is he not
Please announce me

The hall porter sullenly pulled a bell that rang upstairs and turned
away

Princess Drubetskya to see Prince Vasli Sergevich he called to a
footman dressed in knee breeches shoes and a swallowtail coat who
ran downstairs and looked over from the halfway landing

The mother smoothed the folds of her dyed silk dress before a large
Venetian mirror in the wall and in her troddendown shoes briskly
ascended the carpeted stairs

My dear she said to her son once more stimulating him by a touch
you promised me

The son lowering his eyes followed her quietly

They entered the large hall from which one of the doors led to the
apartments assigned to Prince Vasli

Just as the mother and son having reached the middle of the hall were
about to ask their way of an elderly footman who had sprung up as they
entered the bronze handle of one of the doors turned and Prince Vasli
came outwearing a velvet coat with a single star on his breast as was
his custom when at hometaking leave of a goodlooking darkhaired man
This was the celebrated Petersburg doctor Lorrain

Then it is certain said the prince

Prince humanum est errare but replied the doctor swallowing
his rs and pronouncing the Latin words with a French accent

 To err is human

Very well very well

Seeing Anna Mikhylovna and her son Prince Vasli dismissed the doctor
with a bow and approached them silently and with a look of inquiry The
son noticed that an expression of profound sorrow suddenly clouded his
mothers face and he smiled slightly

Ah Prince In what sad circumstances we meet again And how is our
dear invalid said she as though unaware of the cold offensive look
fixed on her

Prince Vasli stared at her and at Bors questioningly and perplexed
Bors bowed politely Prince Vasli without acknowledging the bow turned
to Anna Mikhylovna answering her query by a movement of the head and
lips indicating very little hope for the patient

Is it possible exclaimed Anna Mikhylovna Oh how awful It is
terrible to think This is my son she added indicating Bors He
wanted to thank you himself

Bors bowed again politely

Believe me Prince a mothers heart will never forget what you have
done for us

I am glad I was able to do you a service my dear Anna Mikhylovna
said Prince Vasli arranging his lace frill and in tone and manner
here in Moscow to Anna Mikhylovna whom he had placed under an
obligation assuming an air of much greater importance than he had done
in Petersburg at Anna Schrers reception

Try to serve well and show yourself worthy added he addressing Bors
with severity I am glad Are you here on leave he went on in his
usual tone of indifference

I am awaiting orders to join my new regiment your excellency replied
Bors betraying neither annoyance at the princes brusque manner nor a
desire to enter into conversation but speaking so quietly and
respectfully that the prince gave him a searching glance

Are you living with your mother

I am living at Countess Rostvas replied Bors again adding your
excellency

That is with Ily Rostv who married Nataly Shinshn said Anna
Mikhylovna

I know I know answered Prince Vasli in his monotonous voice I
never could understand how Nataly made up her mind to marry that
unlicked bear A perfectly absurd and stupid fellow and a gambler too
I am told

But a very kind man Prince said Anna Mikhylovna with a pathetic
smile as though she too knew that Count Rostv deserved this censure
but asked him not to be too hard on the poor old man What do the
doctors say asked the princess after a pause her worn face again
expressing deep sorrow

They give little hope replied the prince

And I should so like to thank Uncle once for all his kindness to me and
Bors He is his godson she added her tone suggesting that this fact
ought to give Prince Vasli much satisfaction

Prince Vasli became thoughtful and frowned Anna Mikhylovna saw that
he was afraid of finding in her a rival for Count Bezkhovs fortune
and hastened to reassure him

If it were not for my sincere affection and devotion to Uncle said
she uttering the word with peculiar assurance and unconcern I know
his character noble upright but you see he has no one with him
except the young princesses They are still young She bent her
head and continued in a whisper Has he performed his final duty
Prince How priceless are those last moments It can make things no
worse and it is absolutely necessary to prepare him if he is so ill We
women Prince and she smiled tenderly always know how to say these
things I absolutely must see him however painful it may be for me I
am used to suffering

Evidently the prince understood her and also understood as he had done
at Anna Pvlovnas that it would be difficult to get rid of Anna
Mikhylovna

Would not such a meeting be too trying for him dear Anna Mikhylovna
said he Let us wait until evening The doctors are expecting a
crisis

But one cannot delay Prince at such a moment Consider that the
welfare of his soul is at stake Ah it is awful the duties of a
Christian

A door of one of the inner rooms opened and one of the princesses the
counts niece entered with a cold stern face The length of her body
was strikingly out of proportion to her short legs Prince Vasli turned
to her

Well how is he

Still the same but what can you expect this noise said the
princess looking at Anna Mikhylovna as at a stranger

Ah my dear I hardly knew you said Anna Mikhylovna with a happy
smile ambling lightly up to the counts niece I have come and am at
your service to help you nurse my uncle I imagine what you have gone
through and she sympathetically turned up her eyes

The princess gave no reply and did not even smile but left the room as
Anna Mikhylovna took off her gloves and occupying the position she had
conquered settled down in an armchair inviting Prince Vasli to take a
seat beside her

Bors she said to her son with a smile I shall go in to see the
count my uncle but you my dear had better go to Pierre meanwhile and
dont forget to give him the Rostvs invitation They ask him to
dinner I suppose he wont go she continued turning to the prince

On the contrary replied the prince who had plainly become depressed
I shall be only too glad if you relieve me of that young man Here
he is and the count has not once asked for him

He shrugged his shoulders A footman conducted Bors down one flight of
stairs and up another to Pierres rooms





CHAPTER XVI

Pierre after all had not managed to choose a career for himself in
Petersburg and had been expelled from there for riotous conduct and
sent to Moscow The story told about him at Count Rostvs was true
Pierre had taken part in tying a policeman to a bear He had now been
for some days in Moscow and was staying as usual at his fathers house
Though he expected that the story of his escapade would be already known
in Moscow and that the ladies about his fatherwho were never favorably
disposed toward himwould have used it to turn the count against him he
nevertheless on the day of his arrival went to his fathers part of the
house Entering the drawing room where the princesses spent most of
their time he greeted the ladies two of whom were sitting at
embroidery frames while a third read aloud It was the eldest who was
readingthe one who had met Anna Mikhylovna The two younger ones were
embroidering both were rosy and pretty and they differed only in that
one had a little mole on her lip which made her much prettier Pierre
was received as if he were a corpse or a leper The eldest princess
paused in her reading and silently stared at him with frightened eyes
the second assumed precisely the same expression while the youngest
the one with the mole who was of a cheerful and lively disposition
bent over her frame to hide a smile probably evoked by the amusing scene
she foresaw She drew her wool down through the canvas and scarcely
able to refrain from laughing stooped as if trying to make out the
pattern

How do you do cousin said Pierre You dont recognize me

I recognize you only too well too well

How is the count Can I see him asked Pierre awkwardly as usual but
unabashed

The count is suffering physically and mentally and apparently you have
done your best to increase his mental sufferings

Can I see the count Pierre again asked

Hm If you wish to kill him to kill him outright you can see
him Olga go and see whether Uncles beef tea is readyit is almost
time she added giving Pierre to understand that they were busy and
busy making his father comfortable while evidently he Pierre was only
busy causing him annoyance

Olga went out Pierre stood looking at the sisters then he bowed and
said Then I will go to my rooms You will let me know when I can see
him

And he left the room followed by the low but ringing laughter of the
sister with the mole

Next day Prince Vasli had arrived and settled in the counts house He
sent for Pierre and said to him My dear fellow if you are going to
behave here as you did in Petersburg you will end very badly that is
all I have to say to you The count is very very ill and you must not
see him at all

Since then Pierre had not been disturbed and had spent the whole time in
his rooms upstairs

When Bors appeared at his door Pierre was pacing up and down his room
stopping occasionally at a corner to make menacing gestures at the wall
as if running a sword through an invisible foe and glaring savagely
over his spectacles and then again resuming his walk muttering
indistinct words shrugging his shoulders and gesticulating

England is done for said he scowling and pointing his finger at
someone unseen Mr Pitt as a traitor to the nation and to the rights
of man is sentenced to But before Pierrewho at that moment
imagined himself to be Napoleon in person and to have just effected the
dangerous crossing of the Straits of Dover and captured Londoncould
pronounce Pitts sentence he saw a wellbuilt and handsome young
officer entering his room Pierre paused He had left Moscow when Bors
was a boy of fourteen and had quite forgotten him but in his usual
impulsive and hearty way he took Bors by the hand with a friendly
smile

Do you remember me asked Bors quietly with a pleasant smile I have
come with my mother to see the count but it seems he is not well

Yes it seems he is ill People are always disturbing him answered
Pierre trying to remember who this young man was

Bors felt that Pierre did not recognize him but did not consider it
necessary to introduce himself and without experiencing the least
embarrassment looked Pierre straight in the face

Count Rostv asks you to come to dinner today said he after a
considerable pause which made Pierre feel uncomfortable

Ah Count Rostv exclaimed Pierre joyfully Then you are his son
Ily Only fancy I didnt know you at first Do you remember how we
went to the Sparrow Hills with Madame Jacquot Its such an age

You are mistaken said Bors deliberately with a bold and slightly
sarcastic smile I am Bors son of Princess Anna Mikhylovna
Drubetskya Rostv the father is Ily and his son is Nicholas I
never knew any Madame Jacquot

Pierre shook his head and arms as if attacked by mosquitoes or bees

Oh dear what am I thinking about Ive mixed everything up One has so
many relatives in Moscow So you are Bors Of course Well now we know
where we are And what do you think of the Boulogne expedition The
English will come off badly you know if Napoleon gets across the
Channel I think the expedition is quite feasible If only Villeneuve
doesnt make a mess of things

Bors knew nothing about the Boulogne expedition he did not read the
papers and it was the first time he had heard Villeneuves name

We here in Moscow are more occupied with dinner parties and scandal
than with politics said he in his quiet ironical tone I know nothing
about it and have not thought about it Moscow is chiefly busy with
gossip he continued Just now they are talking about you and your
father

Pierre smiled in his goodnatured way as if afraid for his companions
sake that the latter might say something he would afterwards regret But
Bors spoke distinctly clearly and dryly looking straight into
Pierres eyes

Moscow has nothing else to do but gossip Bors went on Everybody is
wondering to whom the count will leave his fortune though he may
perhaps outlive us all as I sincerely hope he will

Yes it is all very horrid interrupted Pierre very horrid

Pierre was still afraid that this officer might inadvertently say
something disconcerting to himself

And it must seem to you said Bors flushing slightly but not
changing his tone or attitude it must seem to you that everyone is
trying to get something out of the rich man

So it does thought Pierre

But I just wish to say to avoid misunderstandings that you are quite
mistaken if you reckon me or my mother among such people We are very
poor but for my own part at any rate for the very reason that your
father is rich I dont regard myself as a relation of his and neither
I nor my mother would ever ask or take anything from him

For a long time Pierre could not understand but when he did he jumped
up from the sofa seized Bors under the elbow in his quick clumsy way
and blushing far more than Bors began to speak with a feeling of
mingled shame and vexation

Well this is strange Do you suppose I who could think I know
very well

But Bors again interrupted him

I am glad I have spoken out fully Perhaps you did not like it You
must excuse me said he putting Pierre at ease instead of being put at
ease by him but I hope I have not offended you I always make it a
rule to speak out Well what answer am I to take Will you come to
dinner at the Rostvs

And Bors having apparently relieved himself of an onerous duty and
extricated himself from an awkward situation and placed another in it
became quite pleasant again

No but I say said Pierre calming down you are a wonderful fellow
What you have just said is good very good Of course you dont know me
We have not met for such a long time not since we were children You
might think that I I understand quite understand I could not have
done it myself I should not have had the courage but its splendid I
am very glad to have made your acquaintance Its queer he added after
a pause that you should have suspected me He began to laugh Well
what of it I hope well get better acquainted and he pressed Bors
hand Do you know I have not once been in to see the count He has not
sent for me I am sorry for him as a man but what can one do

And so you think Napoleon will manage to get an army across asked
Bors with a smile

Pierre saw that Bors wished to change the subject and being of the
same mind he began explaining the advantages and disadvantages of the
Boulogne expedition

A footman came in to summon Borsthe princess was going Pierre in
order to make Bors better acquaintance promised to come to dinner
and warmly pressing his hand looked affectionately over his spectacles
into Bors eyes After he had gone Pierre continued pacing up and down
the room for a long time no longer piercing an imaginary foe with his
imaginary sword but smiling at the remembrance of that pleasant
intelligent and resolute young man

As often happens in early youth especially to one who leads a lonely
life he felt an unaccountable tenderness for this young man and made up
his mind that they would be friends

Prince Vasli saw the princess off She held a handkerchief to her eyes
and her face was tearful

It is dreadful dreadful she was saying but cost me what it may I
shall do my duty I will come and spend the night He must not be left
like this Every moment is precious I cant think why his nieces put it
off Perhaps God will help me to find a way to prepare him Adieu
Prince May God support you

Adieu ma bonne answered Prince Vasli turning away from her

Oh he is in a dreadful state said the mother to her son when they
were in the carriage He hardly recognizes anybody

I dont understand Mammawhat is his attitude to Pierre asked the
son

The will will show that my dear our fate also depends on it

But why do you expect that he will leave us anything

Ah my dear He is so rich and we are so poor

Well that is hardly a sufficient reason Mamma

Oh Heaven How ill he is exclaimed the mother





CHAPTER XVII

After Anna Mikhylovna had driven off with her son to visit Count Cyril
Vladmirovich Bezkhov Countess Rostva sat for a long time all alone
applying her handkerchief to her eyes At last she rang

What is the matter with you my dear she said crossly to the maid who
kept her waiting some minutes Dont you wish to serve me Then Ill
find you another place

The countess was upset by her friends sorrow and humiliating poverty
and was therefore out of sorts a state of mind which with her always
found expression in calling her maid my dear and speaking to her with
exaggerated politeness

I am very sorry maam answered the maid

Ask the count to come to me

The count came waddling in to see his wife with a rather guilty look as
usual

Well little countess What a saut of game au madre we are to have
my dear I tasted it The thousand rubles I paid for Tars were not ill
spent He is worth it

He sat down by his wife his elbows on his knees and his hands ruffling
his gray hair

What are your commands little countess

You see my dear Whats that mess she said pointing to his
waistcoat Its the saut most likely she added with a smile Well
you see Count I want some money

Her face became sad

Oh little countess and the count began bustling to get out his
pocketbook

I want a great deal Count I want five hundred rubles and taking out
her cambric handkerchief she began wiping her husbands waistcoat

Yes immediately immediately Hey whos there he called out in a
tone only used by persons who are certain that those they call will rush
to obey the summons Send Dmtri to me

Dmtri a man of good family who had been brought up in the counts
house and now managed all his affairs stepped softly into the room

This is what I want my dear fellow said the count to the deferential
young man who had entered Bring me he reflected a moment yes
bring me seven hundred rubles yes But mind dont bring me such
tattered and dirty notes as last time but nice clean ones for the
countess

Yes Dmtri clean ones please said the countess sighing deeply

When would you like them your excellency asked Dmtri Allow me to
inform you But dont be uneasy he added noticing that the count
was beginning to breathe heavily and quickly which was always a sign of
approaching anger I was forgetting Do you wish it brought at once

Yes yes just so Bring it Give it to the countess

What a treasure that Dmtri is added the count with a smile when the
young man had departed There is never any impossible with him
Thats a thing I hate Everything is possible

Ah money Count money How much sorrow it causes in the world said
the countess But I am in great need of this sum

You my little countess are a notorious spendthrift said the count
and having kissed his wifes hand he went back to his study

When Anna Mikhylovna returned from Count Bezkhovs the money all in
clean notes was lying ready under a handkerchief on the countess
little table and Anna Mikhylovna noticed that something was agitating
her

Well my dear asked the countess

Oh what a terrible state he is in One would not know him he is so
ill I was only there a few moments and hardly said a word

Annette for heavens sake dont refuse me the countess began with a
blush that looked very strange on her thin dignified elderly face and
she took the money from under the handkerchief

Anna Mikhylovna instantly guessed her intention and stooped to be ready
to embrace the countess at the appropriate moment

This is for Bors from me for his outfit

Anna Mikhylovna was already embracing her and weeping The countess
wept too They wept because they were friends and because they were
kindhearted and because theyfriends from childhoodhad to think about
such a base thing as money and because their youth was over But
those tears were pleasant to them both





CHAPTER XVIII

Countess Rostva with her daughters and a large number of guests was
already seated in the drawing room The count took the gentlemen into
his study and showed them his choice collection of Turkish pipes From
time to time he went out to ask Hasnt she come yet They were
expecting Mrya Dmtrievna Akhrosmova known in society as le terrible
dragon a lady distinguished not for wealth or rank but for common
sense and frank plainness of speech Mrya Dmtrievna was known to the
Imperial family as well as to all Moscow and Petersburg and both cities
wondered at her laughed privately at her rudenesses and told good
stories about her while none the less all without exception respected
and feared her

In the counts room which was full of tobacco smoke they talked of war
that had been announced in a manifesto and about the recruiting None
of them had yet seen the manifesto but they all knew it had appeared
The count sat on the sofa between two guests who were smoking and
talking He neither smoked nor talked but bending his head first to one
side and then to the other watched the smokers with evident pleasure and
listened to the conversation of his two neighbors whom he egged on
against each other

One of them was a sallow cleanshaven civilian with a thin and wrinkled
face already growing old though he was dressed like a most fashionable
young man He sat with his legs up on the sofa as if quite at home and
having stuck an amber mouthpiece far into his mouth was inhaling the
smoke spasmodically and screwing up his eyes This was an old bachelor
Shinshn a cousin of the countess a man with a sharp tongue as they
said in Moscow society He seemed to be condescending to his companion
The latter a fresh rosy officer of the Guards irreproachably washed
brushed and buttoned held his pipe in the middle of his mouth and with
red lips gently inhaled the smoke letting it escape from his handsome
mouth in rings This was Lieutenant Berg an officer in the Semnov
regiment with whom Bors was to travel to join the army and about whom
Natsha had teased her elder sister Vra speaking of Berg as her
intended The count sat between them and listened attentively His
favorite occupation when not playing boston a card game he was very
fond of was that of listener especially when he succeeded in setting
two loquacious talkers at one another

Well then old chap mon trs honorable Alphonse Krlovich said
Shinshn laughing ironically and mixing the most ordinary Russian
expressions with the choicest French phraseswhich was a peculiarity of
his speech Vous comptez vous faire des rentes sur ltat you want
to make something out of your company

 You expect to make an income out of the government

No Peter Nikolevich I only want to show that in the cavalry the
advantages are far less than in the infantry Just consider my own
position now Peter Nikolevich

Berg always spoke quietly politely and with great precision His
conversation always related entirely to himself he would remain calm
and silent when the talk related to any topic that had no direct bearing
on himself He could remain silent for hours without being at all put
out of countenance himself or making others uncomfortable but as soon
as the conversation concerned himself he would begin to talk
circumstantially and with evident satisfaction

Consider my position Peter Nikolevich Were I in the cavalry I should
get not more than two hundred rubles every four months even with the
rank of lieutenant but as it is I receive two hundred and thirty said
he looking at Shinshn and the count with a joyful pleasant smile as
if it were obvious to him that his success must always be the chief
desire of everyone else

Besides that Peter Nikolevich by exchanging into the Guards I shall
be in a more prominent position continued Berg and vacancies occur
much more frequently in the Foot Guards Then just think what can be
done with two hundred and thirty rubles I even manage to put a little
aside and to send something to my father he went on emitting a smoke
ring

La balance y est A German knows how to skin a flint as the
proverb says remarked Shinshn moving his pipe to the other side of
his mouth and winking at the count

 So that squares matters

The count burst out laughing The other guests seeing that Shinshn was
talking came up to listen Berg oblivious of irony or indifference
continued to explain how by exchanging into the Guards he had already
gained a step on his old comrades of the Cadet Corps how in wartime the
company commander might get killed and he as senior in the company
might easily succeed to the post how popular he was with everyone in
the regiment and how satisfied his father was with him Berg evidently
enjoyed narrating all this and did not seem to suspect that others
too might have their own interests But all he said was so prettily
sedate and the navet of his youthful egotism was so obvious that he
disarmed his hearers

Well my boy youll get along wherever you gofoot or horsethat Ill
warrant said Shinshn patting him on the shoulder and taking his feet
off the sofa

Berg smiled joyously The count by his guests went into the drawing
room

It was just the moment before a big dinner when the assembled guests
expecting the summons to zakska avoid engaging in any long
conversation but think it necessary to move about and talk in order to
show that they are not at all impatient for their food The host and
hostess look toward the door and now and then glance at one another
and the visitors try to guess from these glances who or what they are
waiting forsome important relation who has not yet arrived or a dish
that is not yet ready

 Hors doeuvres

Pierre had come just at dinnertime and was sitting awkwardly in the
middle of the drawing room on the first chair he had come across
blocking the way for everyone The countess tried to make him talk but
he went on navely looking around through his spectacles as if in search
of somebody and answered all her questions in monosyllables He was in
the way and was the only one who did not notice the fact Most of the
guests knowing of the affair with the bear looked with curiosity at
this big stout quiet man wondering how such a clumsy modest fellow
could have played such a prank on a policeman

You have only lately arrived the countess asked him

Oui madame replied he looking around him

You have not yet seen my husband

Non madame He smiled quite inappropriately

You have been in Paris recently I believe I suppose its very
interesting

Very interesting

The countess exchanged glances with Anna Mikhylovna The latter
understood that she was being asked to entertain this young man and
sitting down beside him she began to speak about his father but he
answered her as he had the countess only in monosyllables The other
guests were all conversing with one another The Razumvskis It was
charming You are very kind Countess Aprksina was heard on all
sides The countess rose and went into the ballroom

Mrya Dmtrievna came her voice from there

Herself came the answer in a rough voice and Mrya Dmtrievna
entered the room

All the unmarried ladies and even the married ones except the very
oldest rose Mrya Dmtrievna paused at the door Tall and stout
holding high her fiftyyearold head with its gray curls she stood
surveying the guests and leisurely arranged her wide sleeves as if
rolling them up Mrya Dmtrievna always spoke in Russian

Health and happiness to her whose name day we are keeping and to her
children she said in her loud fulltoned voice which drowned all
others Well you old sinner she went on turning to the count who
was kissing her hand youre feeling dull in Moscow I daresay Nowhere
to hunt with your dogs But what is to be done old man Just see how
these nestlings are growing up and she pointed to the girls You must
look for husbands for them whether you like it or not

Well said she hows my Cossack Mrya Dmtrievna always called
Natsha a Cossack and she stroked the childs arm as she came up
fearless and gay to kiss her hand I know shes a scamp of a girl but
I like her

She took a pair of pearshaped ruby earrings from her huge reticule and
having given them to the rosy Natsha who beamed with the pleasure of
her saintsday fete turned away at once and addressed herself to
Pierre

Eh eh friend Come here a bit said she assuming a soft high tone
of voice Come here my friend and she ominously tucked up her
sleeves still higher Pierre approached looking at her in a childlike
way through his spectacles

Come nearer come nearer friend I used to be the only one to tell
your father the truth when he was in favor and in your case its my
evident duty She paused All were silent expectant of what was to
follow for this was clearly only a prelude

A fine lad My word A fine lad His father lies on his deathbed and
he amuses himself setting a policeman astride a bear For shame sir
for shame It would be better if you went to the war

She turned away and gave her hand to the count who could hardly keep
from laughing

Well I suppose it is time we were at table said Mrya Dmtrievna

The count went in first with Mrya Dmtrievna the countess followed on
the arm of a colonel of hussars a man of importance to them because
Nicholas was to go with him to the regiment then came Anna Mikhylovna
with Shinshn Berg gave his arm to Vra The smiling Julie Kargina
went in with Nicholas After them other couples followed filling the
whole dining hall and last of all the children tutors and governesses
followed singly The footmen began moving about chairs scraped the
band struck up in the gallery and the guests settled down in their
places Then the strains of the counts household band were replaced by
the clatter of knives and forks the voices of visitors and the soft
steps of the footmen At one end of the table sat the countess with
Mrya Dmtrievna on her right and Anna Mikhylovna on her left the
other lady visitors were farther down At the other end sat the count
with the hussar colonel on his left and Shinshn and the other male
visitors on his right Midway down the long table on one side sat the
grownup young people Vra beside Berg and Pierre beside Bors and on
the other side the children tutors and governesses From behind the
crystal decanters and fruit vases the count kept glancing at his wife
and her tall cap with its lightblue ribbons and busily filled his
neighbors glasses not neglecting his own The countess in turn
without omitting her duties as hostess threw significant glances from
behind the pineapples at her husband whose face and bald head seemed by
their redness to contrast more than usual with his gray hair At the
ladies end an even chatter of voices was heard all the time at the
mens end the voices sounded louder and louder especially that of the
colonel of hussars who growing more and more flushed ate and drank so
much that the count held him up as a pattern to the other guests Berg
with tender smiles was saying to Vra that love is not an earthly but a
heavenly feeling Bors was telling his new friend Pierre who the guests
were and exchanging glances with Natsha who was sitting opposite
Pierre spoke little but examined the new faces and ate a great deal Of
the two soups he chose turtle with savory patties and went on to the
game without omitting a single dish or one of the wines These latter
the butler thrust mysteriously forward wrapped in a napkin from behind
the next mans shoulders and whispered Dry Madeira Hungarian
or Rhine wine as the case might be Of the four crystal glasses
engraved with the counts monogram that stood before his plate Pierre
held out one at random and drank with enjoyment gazing with ever
increasing amiability at the other guests Natsha who sat opposite
was looking at Bors as girls of thirteen look at the boy they are in
love with and have just kissed for the first time Sometimes that same
look fell on Pierre and that funny lively little girls look made him
inclined to laugh without knowing why

Nicholas sat at some distance from Snya beside Julie Kargina to whom
he was again talking with the same involuntary smile Snya wore a
company smile but was evidently tormented by jealousy now she turned
pale now blushed and strained every nerve to overhear what Nicholas and
Julie were saying to one another The governess kept looking round
uneasily as if preparing to resent any slight that might be put upon the
children The German tutor was trying to remember all the dishes wines
and kinds of dessert in order to send a full description of the dinner
to his people in Germany and he felt greatly offended when the butler
with a bottle wrapped in a napkin passed him by He frowned trying to
appear as if he did not want any of that wine but was mortified because
no one would understand that it was not to quench his thirst or from
greediness that he wanted it but simply from a conscientious desire for
knowledge





CHAPTER XIX

At the mens end of the table the talk grew more and more animated The
colonel told them that the declaration of war had already appeared in
Petersburg and that a copy which he had himself seen had that day been
forwarded by courier to the commanderinchief

And why the deuce are we going to fight Bonaparte remarked Shinshn
He has stopped Austrias cackle and I fear it will be our turn next

The colonel was a stout tall plethoric German evidently devoted to
the service and patriotically Russian He resented Shinshns remark

It is for the reasson my goot sir said he speaking with a German
accent for the reasson zat ze Emperor knows zat He declares in ze
manifessto zat he cannot fiew wiz indifference ze danger vreatening
Russia and zat ze safety and dignity of ze Empire as vell as ze sanctity
of its alliances he spoke this last word with particular emphasis as
if in it lay the gist of the matter

Then with the unerring official memory that characterized him he
repeated from the opening words of the manifesto

 and the wish which constitutes the Emperors sole and absolute
aimto establish peace in Europe on firm foundationshas now decided him
to despatch part of the army abroad and to create a new condition for
the attainment of that purpose

Zat my dear sir is vy he concluded drinking a tumbler of wine
with dignity and looking to the count for approval

Connaissezvous le Proverbe Jerome Jerome do not roam but turn
spindles at home said Shinshn puckering his brows and smiling
Cela nous convient merveille2 Suvrov nowhe knew what he was
about yet they beat him plate couture3 and where are we to find
Suvrovs now Je vous demande un peu4 said he continually changing
from French to Russian

Do you know the proverb

2 That suits us down to the ground

3 Hollow

4 I just ask you that

Ve must vight to the last trrop of our plood said the colonel
thumping the table and ve must tie for our Emperor and zen all vill
pe vell And ve must discuss it as little as pooossible he dwelt
particularly on the word possible as pooossible he ended again
turning to the count Zat is how ve old hussars look at it and zeres
an end of it And how do you a young man and a young hussar how do you
judge of it he added addressing Nicholas who when he heard that the
war was being discussed had turned from his partner with eyes and ears
intent on the colonel

I am quite of your opinion replied Nicholas flaming up turning his
plate round and moving his wineglasses about with as much decision and
desperation as though he were at that moment facing some great danger
I am convinced that we Russians must die or conquer he concluded
consciousas were othersafter the words were uttered that his remarks
were too enthusiastic and emphatic for the occasion and were therefore
awkward

What you said just now was splendid said his partner Julie

Snya trembled all over and blushed to her ears and behind them and down
to her neck and shoulders while Nicholas was speaking

Pierre listened to the colonels speech and nodded approvingly

Thats fine said he

The young mans a real hussar shouted the colonel again thumping the
table

What are you making such a noise about over there Mrya Dmtrievnas
deep voice suddenly inquired from the other end of the table What are
you thumping the table for she demanded of the hussar and why are
you exciting yourself Do you think the French are here

I am speaking ze truce replied the hussar with a smile

Its all about the war the count shouted down the table You know my
sons going Mrya Dmtrievna My son is going

I have four sons in the army but still I dont fret It is all in Gods
hands You may die in your bed or God may spare you in a battle
replied Mrya Dmtrievnas deep voice which easily carried the whole
length of the table

Thats true

Once more the conversations concentrated the ladies at the one end and
the mens at the other

You wont ask Natshas little brother was saying I know you wont
ask

I will replied Natsha

Her face suddenly flushed with reckless and joyous resolution She half
rose by a glance inviting Pierre who sat opposite to listen to what
was coming and turning to her mother

Mamma rang out the clear contralto notes of her childish voice
audible the whole length of the table

What is it asked the countess startled but seeing by her daughters
face that it was only mischief she shook a finger at her sternly with a
threatening and forbidding movement of her head

The conversation was hushed

Mamma What sweets are we going to have and Natshas voice sounded
still more firm and resolute

The countess tried to frown but could not Mrya Dmtrievna shook her
fat finger

Cossack she said threateningly

Most of the guests uncertain how to regard this sally looked at the
elders

You had better take care said the countess

Mamma What sweets are we going to have Natsha again cried boldly
with saucy gaiety confident that her prank would be taken in good part

Snya and fat little Ptya doubled up with laughter

You see I have asked whispered Natsha to her little brother and to
Pierre glancing at him again

Ice pudding but you wont get any said Mrya Dmtrievna

Natsha saw there was nothing to be afraid of and so she braved even
Mrya Dmtrievna

Mrya Dmtrievna What kind of ice pudding I dont like ice cream

Carrot ices

No What kind Mrya Dmtrievna What kind she almost screamed I
want to know

Mrya Dmtrievna and the countess burst out laughing and all the guests
joined in Everyone laughed not at Mrya Dmtrievnas answer but at the
incredible boldness and smartness of this little girl who had dared to
treat Mrya Dmtrievna in this fashion

Natsha only desisted when she had been told that there would be
pineapple ice Before the ices champagne was served round The band
again struck up the count and countess kissed and the guests leaving
their seats went up to congratulate the countess and reached across
the table to clink glasses with the count with the children and with
one another Again the footmen rushed about chairs scraped and in the
same order in which they had entered but with redder faces the guests
returned to the drawing room and to the counts study





CHAPTER XX

The card tables were drawn out sets made up for boston and the counts
visitors settled themselves some in the two drawing rooms some in the
sitting room some in the library

The count holding his cards fanwise kept himself with difficulty from
dropping into his usual afterdinner nap and laughed at everything The
young people at the countess instigation gathered round the
clavichord and harp Julie by general request played first After she
had played a little air with variations on the harp she joined the
other young ladies in begging Natsha and Nicholas who were noted for
their musical talent to sing something Natsha who was treated as
though she were grown up was evidently very proud of this but at the
same time felt shy

What shall we sing she said

The Brook suggested Nicholas

Well then lets be quick Bors come here said Natsha But where
is Snya

She looked round and seeing that her friend was not in the room ran to
look for her

Running into Snyas room and not finding her there Natsha ran to the
nursery but Snya was not there either Natsha concluded that she must
be on the chest in the passage The chest in the passage was the place
of mourning for the younger female generation in the Rostv household
And there in fact was Snya lying face downward on Nurses dirty feather
bed on the top of the chest crumpling her gauzy pink dress under her
hiding her face with her slender fingers and sobbing so convulsively
that her bare little shoulders shook Natshas face which had been so
radiantly happy all that saints day suddenly changed her eyes became
fixed and then a shiver passed down her broad neck and the corners of
her mouth drooped

Snya What is it What is the matter Oo Oo Oo And
Natshas large mouth widened making her look quite ugly and she began
to wail like a baby without knowing why except that Snya was crying
Snya tried to lift her head to answer but could not and hid her face
still deeper in the bed Natsha wept sitting on the bluestriped
feather bed and hugging her friend With an effort Snya sat up and
began wiping her eyes and explaining

Nicholas is going away in a weeks time his papers have come
he told me himself but still I should not cry and she showed a
paper she held in her handwith the verses Nicholas had written still
I should not cry but you cant no one can understand what a soul
he has

And she began to cry again because he had such a noble soul

Its all very well for you I am not envious I love you and Bors
also she went on gaining a little strength he is nice there are
no difficulties in your way But Nicholas is my cousin one would
have to the Metropolitan himself and even then it cant be done
And besides if she tells Mamma Snya looked upon the countess as her
mother and called her so that I am spoiling Nicholas career and am
heartless and ungrateful while truly God is my witness and she
made the sign of the cross I love her so much and all of you only
Vra And what for What have I done to her I am so grateful to you
that I would willingly sacrifice everything only I have nothing

Snya could not continue and again hid her face in her hands and in the
feather bed Natsha began consoling her but her face showed that she
understood all the gravity of her friends trouble

Snya she suddenly exclaimed as if she had guessed the true reason
of her friends sorrow Im sure Vra has said something to you since
dinner Hasnt she

Yes these verses Nicholas wrote himself and I copied some others and
she found them on my table and said shed show them to Mamma and that I
was ungrateful and that Mamma would never allow him to marry me but
that hell marry Julie You see how hes been with her all day
Natsha what have I done to deserve it

And again she began to sob more bitterly than before Natsha lifted
her up hugged her and smiling through her tears began comforting
her

Snya dont believe her darling Dont believe her Do you remember
how we and Nicholas all three of us talked in the sitting room after
supper Why we settled how everything was to be I dont quite remember
how but dont you remember that it could all be arranged and how nice
it all was Theres Uncle Shinshns brother has married his first
cousin And we are only second cousins you know And Bors says it is
quite possible You know I have told him all about it And he is so
clever and so good said Natsha Dont you cry Snya dear love
darling Snya and she kissed her and laughed Vras spiteful never
mind her And all will come right and she wont say anything to Mamma
Nicholas will tell her himself and he doesnt care at all for Julie

Natsha kissed her on the hair

Snya sat up The little kitten brightened its eyes shone and it
seemed ready to lift its tail jump down on its soft paws and begin
playing with the ball of worsted as a kitten should

Do you think so Really Truly she said quickly smoothing her
frock and hair

Really truly answered Natsha pushing in a crisp lock that had
strayed from under her friends plaits

Both laughed

Well lets go and sing The Brook

Come along

Do you know that fat Pierre who sat opposite me is so funny said
Natsha stopping suddenly I feel so happy

And she set off at a run along the passage

Snya shaking off some down which clung to her and tucking away the
verses in the bosom of her dress close to her bony little chest ran
after Natsha down the passage into the sitting room with flushed face
and light joyous steps At the visitors request the young people sang
the quartette The Brook with which everyone was delighted Then
Nicholas sang a song he had just learned

At nighttime in the moons fair glow How sweet as fancies wander free
To feel that in this world theres one Who still is thinking but of
thee

That while her fingers touch the harp Wafting sweet music oer the lea
It is for thee thus swells her heart Sighing its message out to thee

A day or two then bliss unspoilt But oh till then I cannot live

He had not finished the last verse before the young people began to get
ready to dance in the large hall and the sound of the feet and the
coughing of the musicians were heard from the gallery

Pierre was sitting in the drawing room where Shinshn had engaged him
as a man recently returned from abroad in a political conversation in
which several others joined but which bored Pierre When the music began
Natsha came in and walking straight up to Pierre said laughing and
blushing

Mamma told me to ask you to join the dancers

I am afraid of mixing the figures Pierre replied but if you will be
my teacher And lowering his big arm he offered it to the slender
little girl

While the couples were arranging themselves and the musicians tuning up
Pierre sat down with his little partner Natsha was perfectly happy
she was dancing with a grownup man who had been abroad She was
sitting in a conspicuous place and talking to him like a grownup lady
She had a fan in her hand that one of the ladies had given her to hold
Assuming quite the pose of a society woman heaven knows when and where
she had learned it she talked with her partner fanning herself and
smiling over the fan

Dear dear Just look at her exclaimed the countess as she crossed
the ballroom pointing to Natsha

Natsha blushed and laughed

Well really Mamma Why should you What is there to be surprised at

In the midst of the third cossaise there was a clatter of chairs being
pushed back in the sitting room where the count and Mrya Dmtrievna had
been playing cards with the majority of the more distinguished and older
visitors They now stretching themselves after sitting so long and
replacing their purses and pocketbooks entered the ballroom First came
Mrya Dmtrievna and the count both with merry countenances The count
with playful ceremony somewhat in ballet style offered his bent arm to
Mrya Dmtrievna He drew himself up a smile of debonair gallantry lit
up his face and as soon as the last figure of the cossaise was ended
he clapped his hands to the musicians and shouted up to their gallery
addressing the first violin

Semn Do you know the Daniel Cooper

This was the counts favorite dance which he had danced in his youth
Strictly speaking Daniel Cooper was one figure of the anglaise

Look at Papa shouted Natsha to the whole company and quite
forgetting that she was dancing with a grownup partner she bent her
curly head to her knees and made the whole room ring with her laughter

And indeed everybody in the room looked with a smile of pleasure at the
jovial old gentleman who standing beside his tall and stout partner
Mrya Dmtrievna curved his arms beat time straightened his
shoulders turned out his toes tapped gently with his foot and by a
smile that broadened his round face more and more prepared the
onlookers for what was to follow As soon as the provocatively gay
strains of Daniel Cooper somewhat resembling those of a merry peasant
dance began to sound all the doorways of the ballroom were suddenly
filled by the domestic serfsthe men on one side and the women on the
otherwho with beaming faces had come to see their master making merry

Just look at the master A regular eagle he is loudly remarked the
nurse as she stood in one of the doorways

The count danced well and knew it But his partner could not and did not
want to dance well Her enormous figure stood erect her powerful arms
hanging down she had handed her reticule to the countess and only her
stern but handsome face really joined in the dance What was expressed
by the whole of the counts plump figure in Mrya Dmtrievna found
expression only in her more and more beaming face and quivering nose
But if the count getting more and more into the swing of it charmed
the spectators by the unexpectedness of his adroit maneuvers and the
agility with which he capered about on his light feet Mrya Dmtrievna
produced no less impression by slight exertionsthe least effort to move
her shoulders or bend her arms when turning or stamp her footwhich
everyone appreciated in view of her size and habitual severity The
dance grew livelier and livelier The other couples could not attract a
moments attention to their own evolutions and did not even try to do
so All were watching the count and Mrya Dmtrievna Natsha kept
pulling everyone by sleeve or dress urging them to look at Papa
though as it was they never took their eyes off the couple In the
intervals of the dance the count breathing deeply waved and shouted to
the musicians to play faster Faster faster and faster lightly more
lightly and yet more lightly whirled the count flying round Mrya
Dmtrievna now on his toes now on his heels until turning his
partner round to her seat he executed the final pas raising his soft
foot backwards bowing his perspiring head smiling and making a wide
sweep with his arm amid a thunder of applause and laughter led by
Natsha Both partners stood still breathing heavily and wiping their
faces with their cambric handkerchiefs

Thats how we used to dance in our time ma chre said the count

That was a Daniel Cooper exclaimed Mrya Dmtrievna tucking up her
sleeves and puffing heavily





CHAPTER XXI

While in the Rostvs ballroom the sixth anglaise was being danced to a
tune in which the weary musicians blundered and while tired footmen and
cooks were getting the supper Count Bezkhov had a sixth stroke The
doctors pronounced recovery impossible After a mute confession
communion was administered to the dying man preparations made for the
sacrament of unction and in his house there was the bustle and thrill
of suspense usual at such moments Outside the house beyond the gates
a group of undertakers who hid whenever a carriage drove up waited in
expectation of an important order for an expensive funeral The Military
Governor of Moscow who had been assiduous in sending aidesdecamp to
inquire after the counts health came himself that evening to bid a
last farewell to the celebrated grandee of Catherines court Count
Bezkhov

The magnificent reception room was crowded Everyone stood up
respectfully when the Military Governor having stayed about half an
hour alone with the dying man passed out slightly acknowledging their
bows and trying to escape as quickly as possible from the glances fixed
on him by the doctors clergy and relatives of the family Prince
Vasli who had grown thinner and paler during the last few days
escorted him to the door repeating something to him several times in
low tones

When the Military Governor had gone Prince Vasli sat down all alone on
a chair in the ballroom crossing one leg high over the other leaning
his elbow on his knee and covering his face with his hand After sitting
so for a while he rose and looking about him with frightened eyes
went with unusually hurried steps down the long corridor leading to the
back of the house to the room of the eldest princess

Those who were in the dimly lit reception room spoke in nervous
whispers and whenever anyone went into or came from the dying mans
room grew silent and gazed with eyes full of curiosity or expectancy at
his door which creaked slightly when opened

The limits of human life are fixed and may not be oerpassed said
an old priest to a lady who had taken a seat beside him and was
listening navely to his words

I wonder is it not too late to administer unction asked the lady
adding the priests clerical title as if she had no opinion of her own
on the subject

Ah madam it is a great sacrament replied the priest passing his
hand over the thin grizzled strands of hair combed back across his bald
head

Who was that The Military Governor himself was being asked at the
other side of the room How younglooking he is

Yes and he is over sixty I hear the count no longer recognizes
anyone They wished to administer the sacrament of unction

I knew someone who received that sacrament seven times

The second princess had just come from the sickroom with her eyes red
from weeping and sat down beside Dr Lorrain who was sitting in a
graceful pose under a portrait of Catherine leaning his elbow on a
table

Beautiful said the doctor in answer to a remark about the weather
The weather is beautiful Princess and besides in Moscow one feels as
if one were in the country

Yes indeed replied the princess with a sigh So he may have
something to drink

Lorrain considered

Has he taken his medicine

Yes

The doctor glanced at his watch

Take a glass of boiled water and put a pinch of cream of tartar and
he indicated with his delicate fingers what he meant by a pinch

Dere has neffer been a gase a German doctor was saying to an aidede
camp dat one liffs after de sird stroke

And what a wellpreserved man he was remarked the aidedecamp And
who will inherit his wealth he added in a whisper

It vont go begging replied the German with a smile

Everyone again looked toward the door which creaked as the second
princess went in with the drink she had prepared according to Lorrains
instructions The German doctor went up to Lorrain

Do you think he can last till morning asked the German addressing
Lorrain in French which he pronounced badly

Lorrain pursing up his lips waved a severely negative finger before
his nose

Tonight not later said he in a low voice and he moved away with a
decorous smile of selfsatisfaction at being able clearly to understand
and state the patients condition

Meanwhile Prince Vasli had opened the door into the princess room

In this room it was almost dark only two tiny lamps were burning before
the icons and there was a pleasant scent of flowers and burnt pastilles
The room was crowded with small pieces of furniture whatnots
cupboards and little tables The quilt of a high white feather bed was
just visible behind a screen A small dog began to bark

Ah is it you cousin

She rose and smoothed her hair which was as usual so extremely smooth
that it seemed to be made of one piece with her head and covered with
varnish

Has anything happened she asked I am so terrified

No there is no change I only came to have a talk about business
Catiche muttered the prince seating himself wearily on the chair she
had just vacated You have made the place warm I must say he
remarked Well sit down lets have a talk

Catherine

I thought perhaps something had happened she said with her unchanging
stonily severe expression and sitting down opposite the prince she
prepared to listen

I wished to get a nap mon cousin but I cant

Well my dear said Prince Vasli taking her hand and bending it
downwards as was his habit

It was plain that this well referred to much that they both
understood without naming

The princess who had a straight rigid body abnormally long for her
legs looked directly at Prince Vasli with no sign of emotion in her
prominent gray eyes Then she shook her head and glanced up at the icons
with a sigh This might have been taken as an expression of sorrow and
devotion or of weariness and hope of resting before long Prince Vasli
understood it as an expression of weariness

And I he said do you think it is easier for me I am as worn out as
a post horse but still I must have a talk with you Catiche a very
serious talk

Prince Vasli said no more and his cheeks began to twitch nervously now
on one side now on the other giving his face an unpleasant expression
which was never to be seen on it in a drawing room His eyes too seemed
strange at one moment they looked impudently sly and at the next
glanced round in alarm

The princess holding her little dog on her lap with her thin bony
hands looked attentively into Prince Vaslis eyes evidently resolved
not to be the first to break silence if she had to wait till morning

Well you see my dear princess and cousin Catherine Semnovna
continued Prince Vasli returning to his theme apparently not without
an inner struggle at such a moment as this one must think of
everything One must think of the future of all of you I love you
all like children of my own as you know

The princess continued to look at him without moving and with the same
dull expression

And then of course my family has also to be considered Prince Vasli
went on testily pushing away a little table without looking at her
You know Catiche that weyou three sisters Mmontov and my wifeare
the counts only direct heirs I know I know how hard it is for you to
talk or think of such matters It is no easier for me but my dear I
am getting on for sixty and must be prepared for anything Do you know I
have sent for Pierre The count pointing to his portrait definitely
demanded that he should be called

Prince Vasli looked questioningly at the princess but could not make
out whether she was considering what he had just said or whether she was
simply looking at him

There is one thing I constantly pray God to grant mon cousin she
replied and it is that He would be merciful to him and would allow his
noble soul peacefully to leave this

Yes yes of course interrupted Prince Vasli impatiently rubbing
his bald head and angrily pulling back toward him the little table that
he had pushed away But in short the fact is you know yourself
that last winter the count made a will by which he left all his
property not to us his direct heirs but to Pierre

He has made wills enough quietly remarked the princess But he
cannot leave the estate to Pierre Pierre is illegitimate

But my dear said Prince Vasli suddenly clutching the little table
and becoming more animated and talking more rapidly what if a letter
has been written to the Emperor in which the count asks for Pierres
legitimation Do you understand that in consideration of the counts
services his request would be granted

The princess smiled as people do who think they know more about the
subject under discussion than those they are talking with

I can tell you more continued Prince Vasli seizing her hand that
letter was written though it was not sent and the Emperor knew of it
The only question is has it been destroyed or not If not then as soon
as all is over and Prince Vasli sighed to intimate what he meant by
the words all is over and the counts papers are opened the will and
letter will be delivered to the Emperor and the petition will certainly
be granted Pierre will get everything as the legitimate son

And our share asked the princess smiling ironically as if anything
might happen only not that

But my poor Catiche it is as clear as daylight He will then be the
legal heir to everything and you wont get anything You must know my
dear whether the will and letter were written and whether they have
been destroyed or not And if they have somehow been overlooked you
ought to know where they are and must find them because

What next the princess interrupted smiling sardonically and not
changing the expression of her eyes I am a woman and you think we are
all stupid but I know this an illegitimate son cannot inherit un
btard she added as if supposing that this translation of the word
would effectively prove to Prince Vasli the invalidity of his
contention

 A bastard

Well really Catiche Cant you understand You are so intelligent
how is it you dont see that if the count has written a letter to the
Emperor begging him to recognize Pierre as legitimate it follows that
Pierre will not be Pierre but will become Count Bezkhov and will then
inherit everything under the will And if the will and letter are not
destroyed then you will have nothing but the consolation of having been
dutiful et tout ce qui sensuit Thats certain

 And all that follows therefrom

I know the will was made but I also know that it is invalid and you
mon cousin seem to consider me a perfect fool said the princess with
the expression women assume when they suppose they are saying something
witty and stinging

My dear Princess Catherine Semnovna began Prince Vasli impatiently
I came here not to wrangle with you but to talk about your interests
as with a kinswoman a good kind true relation And I tell you for the
tenth time that if the letter to the Emperor and the will in Pierres
favor are among the counts papers then my dear girl you and your
sisters are not heiresses If you dont believe me then believe an
expert I have just been talking to Dmtri Onfrich the family
solicitor and he says the same

At this a sudden change evidently took place in the princess ideas her
thin lips grew white though her eyes did not change and her voice when
she began to speak passed through such transitions as she herself
evidently did not expect

That would be a fine thing said she I never wanted anything and I
dont now

She pushed the little dog off her lap and smoothed her dress

And this is gratitudethis is recognition for those who have sacrificed
everything for his sake she cried Its splendid Fine I dont want
anything Prince

Yes but you are not the only one There are your sisters replied
Prince Vasli

But the princess did not listen to him

Yes I knew it long ago but had forgotten I knew that I could expect
nothing but meanness deceit envy intrigue and ingratitudethe
blackest ingratitudein this house

Do you or do you not know where that will is insisted Prince Vasli
his cheeks twitching more than ever

Yes I was a fool I still believed in people loved them and
sacrificed myself But only the base the vile succeed I know who has
been intriguing

The princess wished to rise but the prince held her by the hand She
had the air of one who has suddenly lost faith in the whole human race
She gave her companion an angry glance

There is still time my dear You must remember Catiche that it was
all done casually in a moment of anger of illness and was afterwards
forgotten Our duty my dear is to rectify his mistake to ease his
last moments by not letting him commit this injustice and not to let
him die feeling that he is rendering unhappy those who

Who sacrificed everything for him chimed in the princess who would
again have risen had not the prince still held her fast though he
never could appreciate it No mon cousin she added with a sigh I
shall always remember that in this world one must expect no reward that
in this world there is neither honor nor justice In this world one has
to be cunning and cruel

Now come come Be reasonable I know your excellent heart

No I have a wicked heart

I know your heart repeated the prince I value your friendship and
wish you to have as good an opinion of me Dont upset yourself and let
us talk sensibly while there is still time be it a day or be it but an
hour Tell me all you know about the will and above all where it is
You must know We will take it at once and show it to the count He has
no doubt forgotten it and will wish to destroy it You understand that
my sole desire is conscientiously to carry out his wishes that is my
only reason for being here I came simply to help him and you

Now I see it all I know who has been intriguingI know cried the
princess

Thats not the point my dear

Its that protg of yours that sweet Princess Drubetskya that Anna
Mikhylovna whom I would not take for a housemaid the infamous vile
woman

Do not let us lose any time

Ah dont talk to me Last winter she wheedled herself in here and told
the count such vile disgraceful things about us especially about
SophieI cant repeat themthat it made the count quite ill and he would
not see us for a whole fortnight I know it was then he wrote this vile
infamous paper but I thought the thing was invalid

Weve got to it at lastwhy did you not tell me about it sooner

Its in the inlaid portfolio that he keeps under his pillow said the
princess ignoring his question Now I know Yes if I have a sin a
great sin it is hatred of that vile woman almost shrieked the
princess now quite changed And what does she come worming herself in
here for But I will give her a piece of my mind The time will come





CHAPTER XXII

While these conversations were going on in the reception room and the
princess room a carriage containing Pierre who had been sent for and
Anna Mikhylovna who found it necessary to accompany him was driving
into the court of Count Bezkhovs house As the wheels rolled softly
over the straw beneath the windows Anna Mikhylovna having turned with
words of comfort to her companion realized that he was asleep in his
corner and woke him up Rousing himself Pierre followed Anna
Mikhylovna out of the carriage and only then began to think of the
interview with his dying father which awaited him He noticed that they
had not come to the front entrance but to the back door While he was
getting down from the carriage steps two men who looked like
tradespeople ran hurriedly from the entrance and hid in the shadow of
the wall Pausing for a moment Pierre noticed several other men of the
same kind hiding in the shadow of the house on both sides But neither
Anna Mikhylovna nor the footman nor the coachman who could not help
seeing these people took any notice of them It seems to be all
right Pierre concluded and followed Anna Mikhylovna She hurriedly
ascended the narrow dimly lit stone staircase calling to Pierre who
was lagging behind to follow Though he did not see why it was
necessary for him to go to the count at all still less why he had to go
by the back stairs yet judging by Anna Mikhylovnas air of assurance
and haste Pierre concluded that it was all absolutely necessary
Halfway up the stairs they were almost knocked over by some men who
carrying pails came running downstairs their boots clattering These
men pressed close to the wall to let Pierre and Anna Mikhylovna pass
and did not evince the least surprise at seeing them there

Is this the way to the princesses apartments asked Anna Mikhylovna
of one of them

Yes replied a footman in a bold loud voice as if anything were now
permissible the door to the left maam

Perhaps the count did not ask for me said Pierre when he reached the
landing Id better go to my own room

Anna Mikhylovna paused and waited for him to come up

Ah my friend she said touching his arm as she had done her sons
when speaking to him that afternoon believe me I suffer no less than
you do but be a man

But really hadnt I better go away he asked looking kindly at her
over his spectacles

Ah my dear friend Forget the wrongs that may have been done you
Think that he is your father perhaps in the agony of death She
sighed I have loved you like a son from the first Trust yourself to
me Pierre I shall not forget your interests

Pierre did not understand a word but the conviction that all this had
to be grew stronger and he meekly followed Anna Mikhylovna who was
already opening a door

This door led into a back anteroom An old man a servant of the
princesses sat in a corner knitting a stocking Pierre had never been
in this part of the house and did not even know of the existence of
these rooms Anna Mikhylovna addressing a maid who was hurrying past
with a decanter on a tray as my dear and my sweet asked about the
princess health and then led Pierre along a stone passage The first
door on the left led into the princesses apartments The maid with the
decanter in her haste had not closed the door everything in the house
was done in haste at that time and Pierre and Anna Mikhylovna in
passing instinctively glanced into the room where Prince Vasli and the
eldest princess were sitting close together talking Seeing them pass
Prince Vasli drew back with obvious impatience while the princess
jumped up and with a gesture of desperation slammed the door with all
her might

This action was so unlike her usual composure and the fear depicted on
Prince Vaslis face so out of keeping with his dignity that Pierre
stopped and glanced inquiringly over his spectacles at his guide Anna
Mikhylovna evinced no surprise she only smiled faintly and sighed as
if to say that this was no more than she had expected

Be a man my friend I will look after your interests said she in
reply to his look and went still faster along the passage

Pierre could not make out what it was all about and still less what
watching over his interests meant but he decided that all these
things had to be From the passage they went into a large dimly lit
room adjoining the counts reception room It was one of those sumptuous
but cold apartments known to Pierre only from the front approach but
even in this room there now stood an empty bath and water had been
spilled on the carpet They were met by a deacon with a censer and by a
servant who passed out on tiptoe without heeding them They went into
the reception room familiar to Pierre with two Italian windows opening
into the conservatory with its large bust and full length portrait of
Catherine the Great The same people were still sitting here in almost
the same positions as before whispering to one another All became
silent and turned to look at the pale tearworn Anna Mikhylovna as she
entered and at the big stout figure of Pierre who hanging his head
meekly followed her

Anna Mikhylovnas face expressed a consciousness that the decisive
moment had arrived With the air of a practical Petersburg lady she now
keeping Pierre close beside her entered the room even more boldly than
that afternoon She felt that as she brought with her the person the
dying man wished to see her own admission was assured Casting a rapid
glance at all those in the room and noticing the counts confessor
there she glided up to him with a sort of amble not exactly bowing yet
seeming to grow suddenly smaller and respectfully received the blessing
first of one and then of another priest

God be thanked that you are in time said she to one of the priests
all we relatives have been in such anxiety This young man is the
counts son she added more softly What a terrible moment

Having said this she went up to the doctor

Dear doctor said she this young man is the counts son Is there
any hope

The doctor cast a rapid glance upwards and silently shrugged his
shoulders Anna Mikhylovna with just the same movement raised her
shoulders and eyes almost closing the latter sighed and moved away
from the doctor to Pierre To him in a particularly respectful and
tenderly sad voice she said

Trust in His mercy and pointing out a small sofa for him to sit and
wait for her she went silently toward the door that everyone was
watching and it creaked very slightly as she disappeared behind it

Pierre having made up his mind to obey his monitress implicitly moved
toward the sofa she had indicated As soon as Anna Mikhylovna had
disappeared he noticed that the eyes of all in the room turned to him
with something more than curiosity and sympathy He noticed that they
whispered to one another casting significant looks at him with a kind
of awe and even servility A deference such as he had never before
received was shown him A strange lady the one who had been talking to
the priests rose and offered him her seat an aidedecamp picked up
and returned a glove Pierre had dropped the doctors became respectfully
silent as he passed by and moved to make way for him At first Pierre
wished to take another seat so as not to trouble the lady and also to
pick up the glove himself and to pass round the doctors who were not
even in his way but all at once he felt that this would not do and
that tonight he was a person obliged to perform some sort of awful rite
which everyone expected of him and that he was therefore bound to
accept their services He took the glove in silence from the aidede
camp and sat down in the ladys chair placing his huge hands
symmetrically on his knees in the nave attitude of an Egyptian statue
and decided in his own mind that all was as it should be and that in
order not to lose his head and do foolish things he must not act on his
own ideas tonight but must yield himself up entirely to the will of
those who were guiding him

Not two minutes had passed before Prince Vasli with head erect
majestically entered the room He was wearing his long coat with three
stars on his breast He seemed to have grown thinner since the morning
his eyes seemed larger than usual when he glanced round and noticed
Pierre He went up to him took his hand a thing he never used to do
and drew it downwards as if wishing to ascertain whether it was firmly
fixed on

Courage courage my friend He has asked to see you That is well
and he turned to go

But Pierre thought it necessary to ask How is and hesitated not
knowing whether it would be proper to call the dying man the count
yet ashamed to call him father

He had another stroke about half an hour ago Courage my friend

Pierres mind was in such a confused state that the word stroke
suggested to him a blow from something He looked at Prince Vasli in
perplexity and only later grasped that a stroke was an attack of
illness Prince Vasli said something to Lorrain in passing and went
through the door on tiptoe He could not walk well on tiptoe and his
whole body jerked at each step The eldest princess followed him and
the priests and deacons and some servants also went in at the door
Through that door was heard a noise of things being moved about and at
last Anna Mikhylovna still with the same expression pale but resolute
in the discharge of duty ran out and touching Pierre lightly on the arm
said

The divine mercy is inexhaustible Unction is about to be administered
Come

Pierre went in at the door stepping on the soft carpet and noticed
that the strange lady the aidedecamp and some of the servants all
followed him in as if there were now no further need for permission to
enter that room





CHAPTER XXIII

Pierre well knew this large room divided by columns and an arch its
walls hung round with Persian carpets The part of the room behind the
columns with a high silkcurtained mahogany bedstead on one side and on
the other an immense case containing icons was brightly illuminated
with red light like a Russian church during evening service Under the
gleaming icons stood a long invalid chair and in that chair on snowy
white smooth pillows evidently freshly changed Pierre sawcovered to
the waist by a bright green quiltthe familiar majestic figure of his
father Count Bezkhov with that gray mane of hair above his broad
forehead which reminded one of a lion and the deep characteristically
noble wrinkles of his handsome ruddy face He lay just under the icons
his large thick hands outside the quilt Into the right hand which was
lying palm downwards a wax taper had been thrust between forefinger and
thumb and an old servant bending over from behind the chair held it
in position By the chair stood the priests their long hair falling
over their magnificent glittering vestments with lighted tapers in
their hands slowly and solemnly conducting the service A little behind
them stood the two younger princesses holding handkerchiefs to their
eyes and just in front of them their eldest sister Catiche with a
vicious and determined look steadily fixed on the icons as though
declaring to all that she could not answer for herself should she glance
round Anna Mikhylovna with a meek sorrowful and allforgiving
expression on her face stood by the door near the strange lady Prince
Vasli in front of the door near the invalid chair a wax taper in his
left hand was leaning his left arm on the carved back of a velvet chair
he had turned round for the purpose and was crossing himself with his
right hand turning his eyes upward each time he touched his forehead
His face wore a calm look of piety and resignation to the will of God
If you do not understand these sentiments he seemed to be saying so
much the worse for you

Behind him stood the aidedecamp the doctors and the menservants the
men and women had separated as in church All were silently crossing
themselves and the reading of the church service the subdued chanting
of deep bass voices and in the intervals sighs and the shuffling of
feet were the only sounds that could be heard Anna Mikhylovna with an
air of importance that showed that she felt she quite knew what she was
about went across the room to where Pierre was standing and gave him a
taper He lit it and distracted by observing those around him began
crossing himself with the hand that held the taper

Sophie the rosy laughterloving youngest princess with the mole
watched him She smiled hid her face in her handkerchief and remained
with it hidden for awhile then looking up and seeing Pierre she again
began to laugh She evidently felt unable to look at him without
laughing but could not resist looking at him so to be out of
temptation she slipped quietly behind one of the columns In the midst
of the service the voices of the priests suddenly ceased they whispered
to one another and the old servant who was holding the counts hand got
up and said something to the ladies Anna Mikhylovna stepped forward
and stooping over the dying man beckoned to Lorrain from behind her
back The French doctor held no taper he was leaning against one of the
columns in a respectful attitude implying that he a foreigner in spite
of all differences of faith understood the full importance of the rite
now being performed and even approved of it He now approached the sick
man with the noiseless step of one in full vigor of life with his
delicate white fingers raised from the green quilt the hand that was
free and turning sideways felt the pulse and reflected a moment The
sick man was given something to drink there was a stir around him then
the people resumed their places and the service continued During this
interval Pierre noticed that Prince Vasli left the chair on which he
had been leaning andwith an air which intimated that he knew what he
was about and if others did not understand him it was so much the worse
for themdid not go up to the dying man but passed by him joined the
eldest princess and moved with her to the side of the room where stood
the high bedstead with its silken hangings On leaving the bed both
Prince Vasli and the princess passed out by a back door but returned
to their places one after the other before the service was concluded
Pierre paid no more attention to this occurrence than to the rest of
what went on having made up his mind once for all that what he saw
happening around him that evening was in some way essential

The chanting of the service ceased and the voice of the priest was
heard respectfully congratulating the dying man on having received the
sacrament The dying man lay as lifeless and immovable as before Around
him everyone began to stir steps were audible and whispers among which
Anna Mikhylovnas was the most distinct

Pierre heard her say

Certainly he must be moved onto the bed here it will be impossible

The sick man was so surrounded by doctors princesses and servants that
Pierre could no longer see the reddishyellow face with its gray
manewhich though he saw other faces as well he had not lost sight of
for a single moment during the whole service He judged by the cautious
movements of those who crowded round the invalid chair that they had
lifted the dying man and were moving him

Catch hold of my arm or youll drop him he heard one of the servants
say in a frightened whisper Catch hold from underneath Here
exclaimed different voices and the heavy breathing of the bearers and
the shuffling of their feet grew more hurried as if the weight they
were carrying were too much for them

As the bearers among whom was Anna Mikhylovna passed the young man he
caught a momentary glimpse between their heads and backs of the dying
mans high stout uncovered chest and powerful shoulders raised by
those who were holding him under the armpits and of his gray curly
leonine head This head with its remarkably broad brow and cheekbones
its handsome sensual mouth and its cold majestic expression was not
disfigured by the approach of death It was the same as Pierre
remembered it three months before when the count had sent him to
Petersburg But now this head was swaying helplessly with the uneven
movements of the bearers and the cold listless gaze fixed itself upon
nothing

After a few minutes bustle beside the high bedstead those who had
carried the sick man dispersed Anna Mikhylovna touched Pierres hand
and said Come Pierre went with her to the bed on which the sick man
had been laid in a stately pose in keeping with the ceremony just
completed He lay with his head propped high on the pillows His hands
were symmetrically placed on the green silk quilt the palms downward
When Pierre came up the count was gazing straight at him but with a
look the significance of which could not be understood by mortal man
Either this look meant nothing but that as long as one has eyes they
must look somewhere or it meant too much Pierre hesitated not knowing
what to do and glanced inquiringly at his guide Anna Mikhylovna made
a hurried sign with her eyes glancing at the sick mans hand and moving
her lips as if to send it a kiss Pierre carefully stretching his neck
so as not to touch the quilt followed her suggestion and pressed his
lips to the large boned fleshy hand Neither the hand nor a single
muscle of the counts face stirred Once more Pierre looked
questioningly at Anna Mikhylovna to see what he was to do next Anna
Mikhylovna with her eyes indicated a chair that stood beside the bed
Pierre obediently sat down his eyes asking if he were doing right Anna
Mikhylovna nodded approvingly Again Pierre fell into the navely
symmetrical pose of an Egyptian statue evidently distressed that his
stout and clumsy body took up so much room and doing his utmost to look
as small as possible He looked at the count who still gazed at the
spot where Pierres face had been before he sat down Anna Mikhylovna
indicated by her attitude her consciousness of the pathetic importance
of these last moments of meeting between the father and son This lasted
about two minutes which to Pierre seemed an hour Suddenly the broad
muscles and lines of the counts face began to twitch The twitching
increased the handsome mouth was drawn to one side only now did Pierre
realize how near death his father was and from that distorted mouth
issued an indistinct hoarse sound Anna Mikhylovna looked attentively
at the sick mans eyes trying to guess what he wanted she pointed
first to Pierre then to some drink then named Prince Vasli in an
inquiring whisper then pointed to the quilt The eyes and face of the
sick man showed impatience He made an effort to look at the servant who
stood constantly at the head of the bed

Wants to turn on the other side whispered the servant and got up to
turn the counts heavy body toward the wall

Pierre rose to help him

While the count was being turned over one of his arms fell back
helplessly and he made a fruitless effort to pull it forward Whether he
noticed the look of terror with which Pierre regarded that lifeless arm
or whether some other thought flitted across his dying brain at any
rate he glanced at the refractory arm at Pierres terrorstricken face
and again at the arm and on his face a feeble piteous smile appeared
quite out of keeping with his features that seemed to deride his own
helplessness At sight of this smile Pierre felt an unexpected quivering
in his breast and a tickling in his nose and tears dimmed his eyes The
sick man was turned on to his side with his face to the wall He sighed

He is dozing said Anna Mikhylovna observing that one of the
princesses was coming to take her turn at watching Let us go

Pierre went out





CHAPTER XXIV

There was now no one in the reception room except Prince Vasli and the
eldest princess who were sitting under the portrait of Catherine the
Great and talking eagerly As soon as they saw Pierre and his companion
they became silent and Pierre thought he saw the princess hide
something as she whispered

I cant bear the sight of that woman

Catiche has had tea served in the small drawing room said Prince
Vasli to Anna Mikhylovna Go and take something my poor Anna
Mikhylovna or you will not hold out

To Pierre he said nothing merely giving his arm a sympathetic squeeze
below the shoulder Pierre went with Anna Mikhylovna into the small
drawing room

There is nothing so refreshing after a sleepless night as a cup of this
delicious Russian tea Lorrain was saying with an air of restrained
animation as he stood sipping tea from a delicate Chinese handleless cup
before a table on which tea and a cold supper were laid in the small
circular room Around the table all who were at Count Bezkhovs house
that night had gathered to fortify themselves Pierre well remembered
this small circular drawing room with its mirrors and little tables
During balls given at the house Pierre who did not know how to dance
had liked sitting in this room to watch the ladies who as they passed
through in their ball dresses with diamonds and pearls on their bare
shoulders looked at themselves in the brilliantly lighted mirrors which
repeated their reflections several times Now this same room was dimly
lighted by two candles On one small table tea things and supper dishes
stood in disorder and in the middle of the night a motley throng of
people sat there not merrymaking but somberly whispering and
betraying by every word and movement that they none of them forgot what
was happening and what was about to happen in the bedroom Pierre did
not eat anything though he would very much have liked to He looked
inquiringly at his monitress and saw that she was again going on tiptoe
to the reception room where they had left Prince Vasli and the eldest
princess Pierre concluded that this also was essential and after a
short interval followed her Anna Mikhylovna was standing beside the
princess and they were both speaking in excited whispers

Permit me Princess to know what is necessary and what is not
necessary said the younger of the two speakers evidently in the same
state of excitement as when she had slammed the door of her room

But my dear princess answered Anna Mikhylovna blandly but
impressively blocking the way to the bedroom and preventing the other
from passing wont this be too much for poor Uncle at a moment when he
needs repose Worldly conversation at a moment when his soul is already
prepared

Prince Vasli was seated in an easy chair in his familiar attitude with
one leg crossed high above the other His cheeks which were so flabby
that they looked heavier below were twitching violently but he wore
the air of a man little concerned in what the two ladies were saying

Come my dear Anna Mikhylovna let Catiche do as she pleases You know
how fond the count is of her

I dont even know what is in this paper said the younger of the two
ladies addressing Prince Vasli and pointing to an inlaid portfolio she
held in her hand All I know is that his real will is in his writing
table and this is a paper he has forgotten

She tried to pass Anna Mikhylovna but the latter sprang so as to bar
her path

I know my dear kind princess said Anna Mikhylovna seizing the
portfolio so firmly that it was plain she would not let go easily Dear
princess I beg and implore you have some pity on him Je vous en
conjure

The princess did not reply Their efforts in the struggle for the
portfolio were the only sounds audible but it was evident that if the
princess did speak her words would not be flattering to Anna
Mikhylovna Though the latter held on tenaciously her voice lost none
of its honeyed firmness and softness

Pierre my dear come here I think he will not be out of place in a
family consultation is it not so Prince

Why dont you speak cousin suddenly shrieked the princess so loud
that those in the drawing room heard her and were startled Why do you
remain silent when heaven knows who permits herself to interfere making
a scene on the very threshold of a dying mans room Intriguer she
hissed viciously and tugged with all her might at the portfolio

But Anna Mikhylovna went forward a step or two to keep her hold on the
portfolio and changed her grip

Prince Vasli rose Oh said he with reproach and surprise this is
absurd Come let go I tell you

The princess let go

And you too

But Anna Mikhylovna did not obey him

Let go I tell you I will take the responsibility I myself will go
and ask him I does that satisfy you

But Prince said Anna Mikhylovna after such a solemn sacrament
allow him a moments peace Here Pierre tell them your opinion said
she turning to the young man who having come quite close was gazing
with astonishment at the angry face of the princess which had lost all
dignity and at the twitching cheeks of Prince Vasli

Remember that you will answer for the consequences said Prince Vasli
severely You dont know what you are doing

Vile woman shouted the princess darting unexpectedly at Anna
Mikhylovna and snatching the portfolio from her

Prince Vasli bent his head and spread out his hands

At this moment that terrible door which Pierre had watched so long and
which had always opened so quietly burst noisily open and banged
against the wall and the second of the three sisters rushed out
wringing her hands

What are you doing she cried vehemently He is dying and you leave
me alone with him

Her sister dropped the portfolio Anna Mikhylovna stooping quickly
caught up the object of contention and ran into the bedroom The eldest
princess and Prince Vasli recovering themselves followed her A few
minutes later the eldest sister came out with a pale hard face again
biting her underlip At sight of Pierre her expression showed an
irrepressible hatred

Yes now you may be glad said she this is what you have been
waiting for And bursting into tears she hid her face in her
handkerchief and rushed from the room

Prince Vasli came next He staggered to the sofa on which Pierre was
sitting and dropped onto it covering his face with his hand Pierre
noticed that he was pale and that his jaw quivered and shook as if in an
ague

Ah my friend said he taking Pierre by the elbow and there was in
his voice a sincerity and weakness Pierre had never observed in it
before How often we sin how much we deceive and all for what I am
near sixty dear friend I too All will end in death all Death is
awful and he burst into tears

Anna Mikhylovna came out last She approached Pierre with slow quiet
steps

Pierre she said

Pierre gave her an inquiring look She kissed the young man on his
forehead wetting him with her tears Then after a pause she said

He is no more

Pierre looked at her over his spectacles

Come I will go with you Try to weep nothing gives such relief as
tears

She led him into the dark drawing room and Pierre was glad no one could
see his face Anna Mikhylovna left him and when she returned he was
fast asleep with his head on his arm

In the morning Anna Mikhylovna said to Pierre

Yes my dear this is a great loss for us all not to speak of you But
God will support you you are young and are now I hope in command of
an immense fortune The will has not yet been opened I know you well
enough to be sure that this will not turn your head but it imposes
duties on you and you must be a man

Pierre was silent

Perhaps later on I may tell you my dear boy that if I had not been
there God only knows what would have happened You know Uncle promised
me only the day before yesterday not to forget Bors But he had no
time I hope my dear friend you will carry out your fathers wish

Pierre understood nothing of all this and coloring shyly looked in
silence at Princess Anna Mikhylovna After her talk with Pierre Anna
Mikhylovna returned to the Rostvs and went to bed On waking in the
morning she told the Rostvs and all her acquaintances the details of
Count Bezkhovs death She said the count had died as she would herself
wish to die that his end was not only touching but edifying As to the
last meeting between father and son it was so touching that she could
not think of it without tears and did not know which had behaved better
during those awful momentsthe father who so remembered everything and
everybody at last and had spoken such pathetic words to the son or
Pierre whom it had been pitiful to see so stricken was he with grief
though he tried hard to hide it in order not to sadden his dying father
It is painful but it does one good It uplifts the soul to see such
men as the old count and his worthy son said she Of the behavior of
the eldest princess and Prince Vasli she spoke disapprovingly but in
whispers and as a great secret





CHAPTER XXV

At Bald Hills Prince Nicholas Andrevich Bolknskis estate the
arrival of young Prince Andrew and his wife was daily expected but this
expectation did not upset the regular routine of life in the old
princes household General in Chief Prince Nicholas Andrevich
nicknamed in society the King of Prussia ever since the Emperor
Paul had exiled him to his country estate had lived there continuously
with his daughter Princess Mary and her companion Mademoiselle
Bourienne Though in the new reign he was free to return to the
capitals he still continued to live in the country remarking that
anyone who wanted to see him could come the hundred miles from Moscow to
Bald Hills while he himself needed no one and nothing He used to say
that there are only two sources of human viceidleness and superstition
and only two virtuesactivity and intelligence He himself undertook his
daughters education and to develop these two cardinal virtues in her
gave her lessons in algebra and geometry till she was twenty and
arranged her life so that her whole time was occupied He was himself
always occupied writing his memoirs solving problems in higher
mathematics turning snuffboxes on a lathe working in the garden or
superintending the building that was always going on at his estate As
regularity is a prime condition facilitating activity regularity in his
household was carried to the highest point of exactitude He always came
to table under precisely the same conditions and not only at the same
hour but at the same minute With those about him from his daughter to
his serfs the prince was sharp and invariably exacting so that without
being a hardhearted man he inspired such fear and respect as few
hardhearted men would have aroused Although he was in retirement and
had now no influence in political affairs every high official appointed
to the province in which the princes estate lay considered it his duty
to visit him and waited in the lofty antechamber just as the architect
gardener or Princess Mary did till the prince appeared punctually to
the appointed hour Everyone sitting in this antechamber experienced the
same feeling of respect and even fear when the enormously high study
door opened and showed the figure of a rather small old man with
powdered wig small withered hands and bushy gray eyebrows which when
he frowned sometimes hid the gleam of his shrewd youthfully glittering
eyes

On the morning of the day that the young couple were to arrive Princess
Mary entered the antechamber as usual at the time appointed for the
morning greeting crossing herself with trepidation and repeating a
silent prayer Every morning she came in like that and every morning
prayed that the daily interview might pass off well

An old powdered manservant who was sitting in the antechamber rose
quietly and said in a whisper Please walk in

Through the door came the regular hum of a lathe The princess timidly
opened the door which moved noiselessly and easily She paused at the
entrance The prince was working at the lathe and after glancing round
continued his work

The enormous study was full of things evidently in constant use The
large table covered with books and plans the tall glassfronted
bookcases with keys in the locks the high desk for writing while
standing up on which lay an open exercise book and the lathe with
tools laid ready to hand and shavings scattered aroundall indicated
continuous varied and orderly activity The motion of the small foot
shod in a Tartar boot embroidered with silver and the firm pressure of
the lean sinewy hand showed that the prince still possessed the
tenacious endurance and vigor of hardy old age After a few more turns
of the lathe he removed his foot from the pedal wiped his chisel
dropped it into a leather pouch attached to the lathe and approaching
the table summoned his daughter He never gave his children a blessing
so he simply held out his bristly cheek as yet unshaven and regarding
her tenderly and attentively said severely

Quite well All right then sit down He took the exercise book
containing lessons in geometry written by himself and drew up a chair
with his foot

For tomorrow said he quickly finding the page and making a scratch
from one paragraph to another with his hard nail

The princess bent over the exercise book on the table

Wait a bit heres a letter for you said the old man suddenly taking
a letter addressed in a womans hand from a bag hanging above the table
onto which he threw it

At the sight of the letter red patches showed themselves on the
princess face She took it quickly and bent her head over it

From Hlose asked the prince with a cold smile that showed his still
sound yellowish teeth

Yes its from Julie replied the princess with a timid glance and a
timid smile

Ill let two more letters pass but the third Ill read said the
prince sternly Im afraid you write much nonsense Ill read the
third

Read this if you like Father said the princess blushing still more
and holding out the letter

The third I said the third cried the prince abruptly pushing the
letter away and leaning his elbows on the table he drew toward him the
exercise book containing geometrical figures

Well madam he began stooping over the book close to his daughter
and placing an arm on the back of the chair on which she sat so that
she felt herself surrounded on all sides by the acrid scent of old age
and tobacco which she had known so long Now madam these triangles
are equal please note that the angle ABC

The princess looked in a scared way at her fathers eyes glittering
close to her the red patches on her face came and went and it was
plain that she understood nothing and was so frightened that her fear
would prevent her understanding any of her fathers further
explanations however clear they might be Whether it was the teachers
fault or the pupils this same thing happened every day the princess
eyes grew dim she could not see and could not hear anything but was
only conscious of her stern fathers withered face close to her of his
breath and the smell of him and could think only of how to get away
quickly to her own room to make out the problem in peace The old man
was beside himself moved the chair on which he was sitting noisily
backward and forward made efforts to control himself and not become
vehement but almost always did become vehement scolded and sometimes
flung the exercise book away

The princess gave a wrong answer

Well now isnt she a fool shouted the prince pushing the book aside
and turning sharply away but rising immediately he paced up and down
lightly touched his daughters hair and sat down again

He drew up his chair and continued to explain

This wont do Princess it wont do said he when Princess Mary
having taken and closed the exercise book with the next days lesson
was about to leave Mathematics are most important madam I dont want
to have you like our silly ladies Get used to it and youll like it
and he patted her cheek It will drive all the nonsense out of your
head

She turned to go but he stopped her with a gesture and took an uncut
book from the high desk

Here is some sort of Key to the Mysteries that your Hlose has sent
you Religious I dont interfere with anyones belief I have looked
at it Take it Well now go Go

He patted her on the shoulder and himself closed the door after her

Princess Mary went back to her room with the sad scared expression that
rarely left her and which made her plain sickly face yet plainer She
sat down at her writing table on which stood miniature portraits and
which was littered with books and papers The princess was as untidy as
her father was tidy She put down the geometry book and eagerly broke
the seal of her letter It was from her most intimate friend from
childhood that same Julie Kargina who had been at the Rostvs name
day party

Julie wrote in French

Dear and precious Friend How terrible and frightful a thing is
separation Though I tell myself that half my life and half my happiness
are wrapped up in you and that in spite of the distance separating us
our hearts are united by indissoluble bonds my heart rebels against
fate and in spite of the pleasures and distractions around me I cannot
overcome a certain secret sorrow that has been in my heart ever since we
parted Why are we not together as we were last summer in your big
study on the blue sofa the confidential sofa Why cannot I now as
three months ago draw fresh moral strength from your look so gentle
calm and penetrating a look I loved so well and seem to see before me
as I write

Having read thus far Princess Mary sighed and glanced into the mirror
which stood on her right It reflected a weak ungraceful figure and
thin face Her eyes always sad now looked with particular hopelessness
at her reflection in the glass She flatters me thought the princess
turning away and continuing to read But Julie did not flatter her
friend the princess eyeslarge deep and luminous it seemed as if at
times there radiated from them shafts of warm lightwere so beautiful
that very often in spite of the plainness of her face they gave her an
attraction more powerful than that of beauty But the princess never saw
the beautiful expression of her own eyesthe look they had when she was
not thinking of herself As with everyone her face assumed a forced
unnatural expression as soon as she looked in a glass She went on
reading

All Moscow talks of nothing but war One of my two brothers is already
abroad the other is with the Guards who are starting on their march to
the frontier Our dear Emperor has left Petersburg and it is thought
intends to expose his precious person to the chances of war God grant
that the Corsican monster who is destroying the peace of Europe may be
overthrown by the angel whom it has pleased the Almighty in His
goodness to give us as sovereign To say nothing of my brothers this
war has deprived me of one of the associations nearest my heart I mean
young Nicholas Rostv who with his enthusiasm could not bear to remain
inactive and has left the university to join the army I will confess to
you dear Mary that in spite of his extreme youth his departure for the
army was a great grief to me This young man of whom I spoke to you
last summer is so nobleminded and full of that real youthfulness which
one seldom finds nowadays among our old men of twenty and particularly
he is so frank and has so much heart He is so pure and poetic that my
relations with him transient as they were have been one of the
sweetest comforts to my poor heart which has already suffered so much
Someday I will tell you about our parting and all that was said then
That is still too fresh Ah dear friend you are happy not to know
these poignant joys and sorrows You are fortunate for the latter are
generally the stronger I know very well that Count Nicholas is too
young ever to be more to me than a friend but this sweet friendship
this poetic and pure intimacy were what my heart needed But enough of
this The chief news about which all Moscow gossips is the death of
old Count Bezkhov and his inheritance Fancy The three princesses
have received very little Prince Vasli nothing and it is Monsieur
Pierre who has inherited all the property and has besides been
recognized as legitimate so that he is now Count Bezkhov and possessor
of the finest fortune in Russia It is rumored that Prince Vasli played
a very despicable part in this affair and that he returned to Petersburg
quite crestfallen

I confess I understand very little about all these matters of wills and
inheritance but I do know that since this young man whom we all used
to know as plain Monsieur Pierre has become Count Bezkhov and the
owner of one of the largest fortunes in Russia I am much amused to
watch the change in the tone and manners of the mammas burdened by
marriageable daughters and of the young ladies themselves toward him
though between you and me he always seemed to me a poor sort of
fellow As for the past two years people have amused themselves by
finding husbands for me most of whom I dont even know the
matchmaking chronicles of Moscow now speak of me as the future Countess
Bezkhova But you will understand that I have no desire for the post
propos of marriages do you know that a while ago that universal auntie
Anna Mikhylovna told me under the seal of strict secrecy of a plan of
marriage for you It is neither more nor less than with Prince Vaslis
son Anatole whom they wish to reform by marrying him to someone rich
and distingue and it is on you that his relations choice has fallen
I dont know what you will think of it but I consider it my duty to let
you know of it He is said to be very handsome and a terrible
scapegrace That is all I have been able to find out about him

But enough of gossip I am at the end of my second sheet of paper and
Mamma has sent for me to go and dine at the Aprksins Read the
mystical book I am sending you it has an enormous success here Though
there are things in it difficult for the feeble human mind to grasp it
is an admirable book which calms and elevates the soul Adieu Give my
respects to monsieur your father and my compliments to Mademoiselle
Bourienne I embrace you as I love you

JULIE

PS Let me have news of your brother and his charming little wife

The princess pondered awhile with a thoughtful smile and her luminous
eyes lit up so that her face was entirely transformed Then she suddenly
rose and with her heavy tread went up to the table She took a sheet of
paper and her hand moved rapidly over it This is the reply she wrote
also in French

Dear and precious Friend Your letter of the 13th has given me great
delight So you still love me my romantic Julie Separation of which
you say so much that is bad does not seem to have had its usual effect
on you You complain of our separation What then should I say if I
dared complain I who am deprived of all who are dear to me Ah if we
had not religion to console us life would be very sad Why do you
suppose that I should look severely on your affection for that young
man On such matters I am only severe with myself I understand such
feelings in others and if never having felt them I cannot approve of
them neither do I condemn them Only it seems to me that Christian
love love of ones neighbor love of ones enemy is worthier sweeter
and better than the feelings which the beautiful eyes of a young man can
inspire in a romantic and loving young girl like yourself

The news of Count Bezkhovs death reached us before your letter and my
father was much affected by it He says the count was the last
representative but one of the great century and that it is his own turn
now but that he will do all he can to let his turn come as late as
possible God preserve us from that terrible misfortune

I cannot agree with you about Pierre whom I knew as a child He always
seemed to me to have an excellent heart and that is the quality I value
most in people As to his inheritance and the part played by Prince
Vasli it is very sad for both Ah my dear friend our divine
Saviours words that it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of
a needle than for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of God are terribly
true I pity Prince Vasli but am still more sorry for Pierre So young
and burdened with such richesto what temptations he will be exposed If
I were asked what I desire most on earth it would be to be poorer than
the poorest beggar A thousand thanks dear friend for the volume you
have sent me and which has such success in Moscow Yet since you tell me
that among some good things it contains others which our weak human
understanding cannot grasp it seems to me rather useless to spend time
in reading what is unintelligible and can therefore bear no fruit I
never could understand the fondness some people have for confusing their
minds by dwelling on mystical books that merely awaken their doubts and
excite their imagination giving them a bent for exaggeration quite
contrary to Christian simplicity Let us rather read the Epistles and
Gospels Let us not seek to penetrate what mysteries they contain for
how can we miserable sinners that we are know the terrible and holy
secrets of Providence while we remain in this flesh which forms an
impenetrable veil between us and the Eternal Let us rather confine
ourselves to studying those sublime rules which our divine Saviour has
left for our guidance here below Let us try to conform to them and
follow them and let us be persuaded that the less we let our feeble
human minds roam the better we shall please God who rejects all
knowledge that does not come from Him and the less we seek to fathom
what He has been pleased to conceal from us the sooner will He
vouchsafe its revelation to us through His divine Spirit

My father has not spoken to me of a suitor but has only told me that he
has received a letter and is expecting a visit from Prince Vasli In
regard to this project of marriage for me I will tell you dear sweet
friend that I look on marriage as a divine institution to which we must
conform However painful it may be to me should the Almighty lay the
duties of wife and mother upon me I shall try to perform them as
faithfully as I can without disquieting myself by examining my feelings
toward him whom He may give me for husband

I have had a letter from my brother who announces his speedy arrival at
Bald Hills with his wife This pleasure will be but a brief one
however for he will leave us again to take part in this unhappy war
into which we have been drawn God knows how or why Not only where you
areat the heart of affairs and of the worldis the talk all of war
even here amid fieldwork and the calm of naturewhich townsfolk consider
characteristic of the countryrumors of war are heard and painfully
felt My father talks of nothing but marches and countermarches things
of which I understand nothing and the day before yesterday during my
daily walk through the village I witnessed a heartrending scene It
was a convoy of conscripts enrolled from our people and starting to join
the army You should have seen the state of the mothers wives and
children of the men who were going and should have heard the sobs It
seems as though mankind has forgotten the laws of its divine Saviour
Who preached love and forgiveness of injuriesand that men attribute the
greatest merit to skill in killing one another

Adieu dear and kind friend may our divine Saviour and His most Holy
Mother keep you in their holy and allpowerful care

MARY

Ah you are sending off a letter Princess I have already dispatched
mine I have written to my poor mother said the smiling Mademoiselle
Bourienne rapidly in her pleasant mellow tones and with guttural rs
She brought into Princess Marys strenuous mournful and gloomy world a
quite different atmosphere careless lighthearted and selfsatisfied

Princess I must warn you she added lowering her voice and evidently
listening to herself with pleasure and speaking with exaggerated
grasseyement the prince has been scolding Michael Ivnovich He is in
a very bad humor very morose Be prepared

Ah dear friend replied Princess Mary I have asked you never to
warn me of the humor my father is in I do not allow myself to judge him
and would not have others do so

The princess glanced at her watch and seeing that she was five minutes
late in starting her practice on the clavichord went into the sitting
room with a look of alarm Between twelve and two oclock as the day
was mapped out the prince rested and the princess played the
clavichord





CHAPTER XXVI

The grayhaired valet was sitting drowsily listening to the snoring of
the prince who was in his large study From the far side of the house
through the closed doors came the sound of difficult passagestwenty
times repeatedof a sonata by Dussek

Just then a closed carriage and another with a hood drove up to the
porch Prince Andrew got out of the carriage helped his little wife to
alight and let her pass into the house before him Old Tkhon wearing
a wig put his head out of the door of the antechamber reported in a
whisper that the prince was sleeping and hastily closed the door
Tkhon knew that neither the sons arrival nor any other unusual event
must be allowed to disturb the appointed order of the day Prince Andrew
apparently knew this as well as Tkhon he looked at his watch as if to
ascertain whether his fathers habits had changed since he was at home
last and having assured himself that they had not he turned to his
wife

He will get up in twenty minutes Let us go across to Marys room he
said

The little princess had grown stouter during this time but her eyes and
her short downy smiling lip lifted when she began to speak just as
merrily and prettily as ever

Why this is a palace she said to her husband looking around with
the expression with which people compliment their host at a ball Lets
come quick quick And with a glance round she smiled at Tkhon at
her husband and at the footman who accompanied them

Is that Mary practicing Lets go quietly and take her by surprise

Prince Andrew followed her with a courteous but sad expression

Youve grown older Tkhon he said in passing to the old man who
kissed his hand

Before they reached the room from which the sounds of the clavichord
came the pretty fairhaired Frenchwoman Mademoiselle Bourienne
rushed out apparently beside herself with delight

Ah what joy for the princess exclaimed she At last I must let her
know

No no please not You are Mademoiselle Bourienne said the little
princess kissing her I know you already through my sisterinlaws
friendship for you She was not expecting us

They went up to the door of the sitting room from which came the sound
of the oftrepeated passage of the sonata Prince Andrew stopped and
made a grimace as if expecting something unpleasant

The little princess entered the room The passage broke off in the
middle a cry was heard then Princess Marys heavy tread and the sound
of kissing When Prince Andrew went in the two princesses who had only
met once before for a short time at his wedding were in each others
arms warmly pressing their lips to whatever place they happened to
touch Mademoiselle Bourienne stood near them pressing her hand to her
heart with a beatific smile and obviously equally ready to cry or to
laugh Prince Andrew shrugged his shoulders and frowned as lovers of
music do when they hear a false note The two women let go of one
another and then as if afraid of being too late seized each others
hands kissing them and pulling them away and again began kissing each
other on the face and then to Prince Andrews surprise both began to
cry and kissed again Mademoiselle Bourienne also began to cry Prince
Andrew evidently felt ill at ease but to the two women it seemed quite
natural that they should cry and apparently it never entered their
heads that it could have been otherwise at this meeting

Ah my dear Ah Mary they suddenly exclaimed and then
laughed I dreamed last nightYou were not expecting us Ah
Mary you have got thinner And you have grown stouter

I knew the princess at once put in Mademoiselle Bourienne

And I had no idea exclaimed Princess Mary Ah Andrew I did not
see you

Prince Andrew and his sister hand in hand kissed one another and he
told her she was still the same crybaby as ever Princess Mary had
turned toward her brother and through her tears the loving warm
gentle look of her large luminous eyes very beautiful at that moment
rested on Prince Andrews face

The little princess talked incessantly her short downy upper lip
continually and rapidly touching her rosy nether lip when necessary and
drawing up again next moment when her face broke into a smile of
glittering teeth and sparkling eyes She told of an accident they had
had on the Spsski Hill which might have been serious for her in her
condition and immediately after that informed them that she had left
all her clothes in Petersburg and that heaven knew what she would have
to dress in here and that Andrew had quite changed and that Kitty
Odntsova had married an old man and that there was a suitor for Mary
a real one but that they would talk of that later Princess Mary was
still looking silently at her brother and her beautiful eyes were full
of love and sadness It was plain that she was following a train of
thought independent of her sisterinlaws words In the midst of a
description of the last Petersburg fete she addressed her brother

So you are really going to the war Andrew she said sighing

Lise sighed too

Yes and even tomorrow replied her brother

He is leaving me here God knows why when he might have had
promotion

Princess Mary did not listen to the end but continuing her train of
thought turned to her sisterinlaw with a tender glance at her figure

Is it certain she said

The face of the little princess changed She sighed and said Yes
quite certain Ah it is very dreadful

Her lip descended She brought her face close to her sisterinlaws and
unexpectedly again began to cry

She needs rest said Prince Andrew with a frown Dont you Lise
Take her to your room and Ill go to Father How is he Just the same

Yes just the same Though I dont know what your opinion will be
answered the princess joyfully

And are the hours the same And the walks in the avenues And the
lathe asked Prince Andrew with a scarcely perceptible smile which
showed that in spite of all his love and respect for his father he was
aware of his weaknesses

The hours are the same and the lathe and also the mathematics and my
geometry lessons said Princess Mary gleefully as if her lessons in
geometry were among the greatest delights of her life

When the twenty minutes had elapsed and the time had come for the old
prince to get up Tkhon came to call the young prince to his father
The old man made a departure from his usual routine in honor of his
sons arrival he gave orders to admit him to his apartments while he
dressed for dinner The old prince always dressed in oldfashioned
style wearing an antique coat and powdered hair and when Prince Andrew
entered his fathers dressing room not with the contemptuous look and
manner he wore in drawing rooms but with the animated face with which
he talked to Pierre the old man was sitting on a large leathercovered
chair wrapped in a powdering mantle entrusting his head to Tkhon

Ah heres the warrior Wants to vanquish Buonaparte said the old
man shaking his powdered head as much as the tail which Tkhon was
holding fast to plait would allow

You at least must tackle him properly or else if he goes on like this
hell soon have us too for his subjects How are you And he held out
his cheek

The old man was in a good temper after his nap before dinner He used
to say that a nap after dinner was silverbefore dinner golden He
cast happy sidelong glances at his son from under his thick bushy
eyebrows Prince Andrew went up and kissed his father on the spot
indicated to him He made no reply on his fathers favorite topicmaking
fun of the military men of the day and more particularly of Bonaparte

Yes Father I have come to you and brought my wife who is pregnant
said Prince Andrew following every movement of his fathers face with
an eager and respectful look How is your health

Only fools and rakes fall ill my boy You know me I am busy from
morning till night and abstemious so of course I am well

Thank God said his son smiling

God has nothing to do with it Well go on he continued returning to
his hobby tell me how the Germans have taught you to fight Bonaparte
by this new science you call strategy

Prince Andrew smiled

Give me time to collect my wits Father said he with a smile that
showed that his fathers foibles did not prevent his son from loving and
honoring him Why I have not yet had time to settle down

Nonsense nonsense cried the old man shaking his pigtail to see
whether it was firmly plaited and grasping his by the hand The house
for your wife is ready Princess Mary will take her there and show her
over and theyll talk nineteen to the dozen Thats their womans way
I am glad to have her Sit down and talk About Mikhelsons army I
understandTolsty s too a simultaneous expedition But whats
the southern army to do Prussia is neutral I know that What about
Austria said he rising from his chair and pacing up and down the room
followed by Tkhon who ran after him handing him different articles of
clothing What of Sweden How will they cross Pomerania

Prince Andrew seeing that his father insisted beganat first
reluctantly but gradually with more and more animation and from habit
changing unconsciously from Russian to French as he went onto explain
the plan of operation for the coming campaign He explained how an army
ninety thousand strong was to threaten Prussia so as to bring her out
of her neutrality and draw her into the war how part of that army was
to join some Swedish forces at Stralsund how two hundred and twenty
thousand Austrians with a hundred thousand Russians were to operate in
Italy and on the Rhine how fifty thousand Russians and as many English
were to land at Naples and how a total force of five hundred thousand
men was to attack the French from different sides The old prince did
not evince the least interest during this explanation but as if he were
not listening to it continued to dress while walking about and three
times unexpectedly interrupted Once he stopped it by shouting The
white one the white one

This meant that Tkhon was not handing him the waistcoat he wanted
Another time he interrupted saying

And will she soon be confined and shaking his head reproachfully
said Thats bad Go on go on

The third interruption came when Prince Andrew was finishing his
description The old man began to sing in the cracked voice of old age
Malbrook sen vaten guerre Dieu sait quand reviendra

 Marlborough is going to the wars God knows when hell return

His son only smiled

I dont say its a plan I approve of said the son I am only telling
you what it is Napoleon has also formed his plan by now not worse than
this one

Well youve told me nothing new and the old man repeated
meditatively and rapidly

Dieu sait quand reviendra Go to the dining room





CHAPTER XXVII

At the appointed hour the prince powdered and shaven entered the
dining room where his daughterinlaw Princess Mary and Mademoiselle
Bourienne were already awaiting him together with his architect who by
a strange caprice of his employers was admitted to table though the
position of that insignificant individual was such as could certainly
not have caused him to expect that honor The prince who generally kept
very strictly to social distinctions and rarely admitted even important
government officials to his table had unexpectedly selected Michael
Ivnovich who always went into a corner to blow his nose on his checked
handkerchief to illustrate the theory that all men are equals and had
more than once impressed on his daughter that Michael Ivnovich was not
a whit worse than you or I At dinner the prince usually spoke to the
taciturn Michael Ivnovich more often than to anyone else

In the dining room which like all the rooms in the house was
exceedingly lofty the members of the household and the footmenone
behind each chairstood waiting for the prince to enter The head
butler napkin on arm was scanning the setting of the table making
signs to the footmen and anxiously glancing from the clock to the door
by which the prince was to enter Prince Andrew was looking at a large
gilt frame new to him containing the genealogical tree of the Princes
Bolknski opposite which hung another such frame with a badly painted
portrait evidently by the hand of the artist belonging to the estate
of a ruling prince in a crownan alleged descendant of Rrik and
ancestor of the Bolknskis Prince Andrew looking again at that
genealogical tree shook his head laughing as a man laughs who looks at
a portrait so characteristic of the original as to be amusing

How thoroughly like him that is he said to Princess Mary who had
come up to him

Princess Mary looked at her brother in surprise She did not understand
what he was laughing at Everything her father did inspired her with
reverence and was beyond question

Everyone has his Achilles heel continued Prince Andrew Fancy with
his powerful mind indulging in such nonsense

Princess Mary could not understand the boldness of her brothers
criticism and was about to reply when the expected footsteps were heard
coming from the study The prince walked in quickly and jauntily as was
his wont as if intentionally contrasting the briskness of his manners
with the strict formality of his house At that moment the great clock
struck two and another with a shrill tone joined in from the drawing
room The prince stood still his lively glittering eyes from under
their thick bushy eyebrows sternly scanned all present and rested on
the little princess She felt as courtiers do when the Tsar enters the
sensation of fear and respect which the old man inspired in all around
him He stroked her hair and then patted her awkwardly on the back of
her neck

Im glad glad to see you he said looking attentively into her
eyes and then quickly went to his place and sat down Sit down sit
down Sit down Michael Ivnovich

He indicated a place beside him to his daughterinlaw A footman moved
the chair for her

Ho ho said the old man casting his eyes on her rounded figure
Youve been in a hurry Thats bad

He laughed in his usual dry cold unpleasant way with his lips only
and not with his eyes

You must walk walk as much as possible as much as possible he said

The little princess did not or did not wish to hear his words She was
silent and seemed confused The prince asked her about her father and
she began to smile and talk He asked about mutual acquaintances and
she became still more animated and chattered away giving him greetings
from various people and retelling the town gossip

Countess Aprksina poor thing has lost her husband and she has cried
her eyes out she said growing more and more lively

As she became animated the prince looked at her more and more sternly
and suddenly as if he had studied her sufficiently and had formed a
definite idea of her he turned away and addressed Michael Ivnovich

Well Michael Ivnovich our Bonaparte will be having a bad time of it
Prince Andrew he always spoke thus of his son has been telling me
what forces are being collected against him While you and I never
thought much of him

Michael Ivnovich did not at all know when you and I had said such
things about Bonaparte but understanding that he was wanted as a peg on
which to hang the princes favorite topic he looked inquiringly at the
young prince wondering what would follow

He is a great tactician said the prince to his son pointing to the
architect

And the conversation again turned on the war on Bonaparte and the
generals and statesmen of the day The old prince seemed convinced not
only that all the men of the day were mere babies who did not know the A
B C of war or of politics and that Bonaparte was an insignificant
little Frenchy successful only because there were no longer any
Potmkins or Suvrovs left to oppose him but he was also convinced that
there were no political difficulties in Europe and no real war but only
a sort of puppet show at which the men of the day were playing
pretending to do something real Prince Andrew gaily bore with his
fathers ridicule of the new men and drew him on and listened to him
with evident pleasure

The past always seems good said he but did not Suvrov himself fall
into a trap Moreau set him and from which he did not know how to
escape

Who told you that Who cried the prince Suvrov And he jerked
away his plate which Tkhon briskly caught Suvrov Consider
Prince Andrew Two Frederick and Suvrov Moreau Moreau would
have been a prisoner if Suvrov had had a free hand but he had the
HofskriegswurstschnappsRath on his hands It would have puzzled the
devil himself When you get there youll find out what those Hofs
kriegswurstRaths are Suvrov couldnt manage them so what chance has
Michael Kutzov No my dear boy he continued you and your generals
wont get on against Buonaparte youll have to call in the French so
that birds of a feather may fight together The German Pahlen has been
sent to New York in America to fetch the Frenchman Moreau he said
alluding to the invitation made that year to Moreau to enter the Russian
service Wonderful Were the Potmkins Suvrovs and Orlvs
Germans No lad either you fellows have all lost your wits or I have
outlived mine May God help you but well see what will happen
Buonaparte has become a great commander among them Hm

I dont at all say that all the plans are good said Prince Andrew I
am only surprised at your opinion of Bonaparte You may laugh as much as
you like but all the same Bonaparte is a great general

Michael Ivnovich cried the old prince to the architect who busy
with his roast meat hoped he had been forgotten Didnt I tell you
Buonaparte was a great tactician Here he says the same thing

To be sure your excellency replied the architect

The prince again laughed his frigid laugh

Buonaparte was born with a silver spoon in his mouth He has got
splendid soldiers Besides he began by attacking Germans And only
idlers have failed to beat the Germans Since the world began everybody
has beaten the Germans They beat no oneexcept one another He made his
reputation fighting them

And the prince began explaining all the blunders which according to
him Bonaparte had made in his campaigns and even in politics His son
made no rejoinder but it was evident that whatever arguments were
presented he was as little able as his father to change his opinion He
listened refraining from a reply and involuntarily wondered how this
old man living alone in the country for so many years could know and
discuss so minutely and acutely all the recent European military and
political events

You think Im an old man and dont understand the present state of
affairs concluded his father But it troubles me I dont sleep at
night Come now where has this great commander of yours shown his
skill he concluded

That would take too long to tell answered the son

Well then go off to your Buonaparte Mademoiselle Bourienne heres
another admirer of that powdermonkey emperor of yours he exclaimed in
excellent French

You know Prince I am not a Bonapartist

Dieu sait quand reviendra hummed the prince out of tune and with a
laugh still more so he quitted the table

The little princess during the whole discussion and the rest of the
dinner sat silent glancing with a frightened look now at her fatherin
law and now at Princess Mary When they left the table she took her
sisterinlaws arm and drew her into another room

What a clever man your father is said she perhaps that is why I am
afraid of him

Oh he is so kind answered Princess Mary





CHAPTER XXVIII

Prince Andrew was to leave next evening The old prince not altering
his routine retired as usual after dinner The little princess was in
her sisterinlaws room Prince Andrew in a traveling coat without
epaulettes had been packing with his valet in the rooms assigned to him
After inspecting the carriage himself and seeing the trunks put in he
ordered the horses to be harnessed Only those things he always kept
with him remained in his room a small box a large canteen fitted with
silver plate two Turkish pistols and a sabera present from his father
who had brought it from the siege of Ochkov All these traveling
effects of Prince Andrews were in very good order new clean and in
cloth covers carefully tied with tapes

When starting on a journey or changing their mode of life men capable
of reflection are generally in a serious frame of mind At such moments
one reviews the past and plans for the future Prince Andrews face
looked very thoughtful and tender With his hands behind him he paced
briskly from corner to corner of the room looking straight before him
and thoughtfully shaking his head Did he fear going to the war or was
he sad at leaving his wifeperhaps both but evidently he did not wish
to be seen in that mood for hearing footsteps in the passage he
hurriedly unclasped his hands stopped at a table as if tying the cover
of the small box and assumed his usual tranquil and impenetrable
expression It was the heavy tread of Princess Mary that he heard

I hear you have given orders to harness she cried panting she had
apparently been running and I did so wish to have another talk with
you alone God knows how long we may again be parted You are not angry
with me for coming You have changed so Andrsha she added as if to
explain such a question

She smiled as she uttered his pet name Andrsha It was obviously
strange to her to think that this stern handsome man should be
Andrshathe slender mischievous boy who had been her playfellow in
childhood

And where is Lise he asked answering her question only by a smile

She was so tired that she has fallen asleep on the sofa in my room Oh
Andrew What a treasure of a wife you have said she sitting down on
the sofa facing her brother She is quite a child such a dear merry
child I have grown so fond of her

Prince Andrew was silent but the princess noticed the ironical and
contemptuous look that showed itself on his face

One must be indulgent to little weaknesses who is free from them
Andrew Dont forget that she has grown up and been educated in society
and so her position now is not a rosy one We should enter into
everyones situation Tout comprendre cest tout pardonner Think
what it must be for her poor thing after what she has been used to to
be parted from her husband and be left alone in the country in her
condition Its very hard

 To understand all is to forgive all

Prince Andrew smiled as he looked at his sister as we smile at those we
think we thoroughly understand

You live in the country and dont think the life terrible he replied

I thats different Why speak of me I dont want any other life
and cant for I know no other But think Andrew for a young society
woman to be buried in the country during the best years of her life all
alonefor Papa is always busy and I well you know what poor
resources I have for entertaining a woman used to the best society
There is only Mademoiselle Bourienne

I dont like your Mademoiselle Bourienne at all said Prince Andrew

No She is very nice and kind and above all shes much to be pitied
She has no one no one To tell the truth I dont need her and shes
even in my way You know I always was a savage and now am even more so
I like being alone Father likes her very much She and Michael
Ivnovich are the two people to whom he is always gentle and kind
because he has been a benefactor to them both As Sterne says We dont
love people so much for the good they have done us as for the good we
have done them Father took her when she was homeless after losing her
own father She is very goodnatured and my father likes her way of
reading She reads to him in the evenings and reads splendidly

To be quite frank Mary I expect Fathers character sometimes makes
things trying for you doesnt it Prince Andrew asked suddenly

Princess Mary was first surprised and then aghast at this question

For me For me Trying for me said she

He always was rather harsh and now I should think hes getting very
trying said Prince Andrew apparently speaking lightly of their father
in order to puzzle or test his sister

You are good in every way Andrew but you have a kind of intellectual
pride said the princess following the train of her own thoughts
rather than the trend of the conversationand thats a great sin How
can one judge Father But even if one might what feeling except
veneration could such a man as my father evoke And I am so contented
and happy with him I only wish you were all as happy as I am

Her brother shook his head incredulously

The only thing that is hard for me I will tell you the truth
Andrew is Fathers way of treating religious subjects I dont
understand how a man of his immense intellect can fail to see what is as
clear as day and can go so far astray That is the only thing that
makes me unhappy But even in this I can see lately a shade of
improvement His satire has been less bitter of late and there was a
monk he received and had a long talk with

Ah my dear I am afraid you and your monk are wasting your powder
said Prince Andrew banteringly yet tenderly

Ah mon ami I only pray and hope that God will hear me Andrew
she said timidly after a moments silence I have a great favor to ask
of you

What is it dear

Nopromise that you will not refuse It will give you no trouble and is
nothing unworthy of you but it will comfort me Promise Andrsha
said she putting her hand in her reticule but not yet taking out what
she was holding inside it as if what she held were the subject of her
request and must not be shown before the request was granted

She looked timidly at her brother

Even if it were a great deal of trouble answered Prince Andrew as
if guessing what it was about

Think what you please I know you are just like Father Think as you
please but do this for my sake Please do Fathers father our
grandfather wore it in all his wars She still did not take out what
she was holding in her reticule So you promise

Of course What is it

Andrew I bless you with this icon and you must promise me you will
never take it off Do you promise

If it does not weigh a hundredweight and wont break my neck To
please you said Prince Andrew But immediately noticing the pained
expression his joke had brought to his sisters face he repented and
added I am glad really dear I am very glad

Against your will He will save and have mercy on you and bring you to
Himself for in Him alone is truth and peace said she in a voice
trembling with emotion solemnly holding up in both hands before her
brother a small oval antique darkfaced icon of the Saviour in a gold
setting on a finely wrought silver chain

She crossed herself kissed the icon and handed it to Andrew

Please Andrew for my sake

Rays of gentle light shone from her large timid eyes Those eyes lit up
the whole of her thin sickly face and made it beautiful Her brother
would have taken the icon but she stopped him Andrew understood
crossed himself and kissed the icon There was a look of tenderness for
he was touched but also a gleam of irony on his face

Thank you my dear She kissed him on the forehead and sat down again
on the sofa They were silent for a while

As I was saying to you Andrew be kind and generous as you always used
to be Dont judge Lise harshly she began She is so sweet so good
natured and her position now is a very hard one

I do not think I have complained of my wife to you Msha or blamed
her Why do you say all this to me

Red patches appeared on Princess Marys face and she was silent as if
she felt guilty

I have said nothing to you but you have already been talked to And I
am sorry for that he went on

The patches grew deeper on her forehead neck and cheeks She tried to
say something but could not Her brother had guessed right the little
princess had been crying after dinner and had spoken of her forebodings
about her confinement and how she dreaded it and had complained of her
fate her fatherinlaw and her husband After crying she had fallen
asleep Prince Andrew felt sorry for his sister

Know this Msha I cant reproach have not reproached and never
shall reproach my wife with anything and I cannot reproach myself with
anything in regard to her and that always will be so in whatever
circumstances I may be placed But if you want to know the truth if
you want to know whether I am happy No Is she happy No But why this
is so I dont know

As he said this he rose went to his sister and stooping kissed her
forehead His fine eyes lit up with a thoughtful kindly and
unaccustomed brightness but he was looking not at his sister but over
her head toward the darkness of the open doorway

Let us go to her I must say goodby Orgo and wake and Ill come in a
moment Petrshka he called to his valet Come here take these away
Put this on the seat and this to the right

Princess Mary rose and moved to the door then stopped and said
Andrew if you had faith you would have turned to God and asked Him to
give you the love you do not feel and your prayer would have been
answered

Well maybe said Prince Andrew Go Msha Ill come immediately

On the way to his sisters room in the passage which connected one wing
with the other Prince Andrew met Mademoiselle Bourienne smiling
sweetly It was the third time that day that with an ecstatic and
artless smile she had met him in secluded passages

Oh I thought you were in your room she said for some reason
blushing and dropping her eyes

Prince Andrew looked sternly at her and an expression of anger suddenly
came over his face He said nothing to her but looked at her forehead
and hair without looking at her eyes with such contempt that the
Frenchwoman blushed and went away without a word When he reached his
sisters room his wife was already awake and her merry voice hurrying
one word after another came through the open door She was speaking as
usual in French and as if after long selfrestraint she wished to make
up for lost time

No but imagine the old Countess Zbova with false curls and her mouth
full of false teeth as if she were trying to cheat old age Ha ha
ha Mary

This very sentence about Countess Zbova and this same laugh Prince
Andrew had already heard from his wife in the presence of others some
five times He entered the room softly The little princess plump and
rosy was sitting in an easy chair with her work in her hands talking
incessantly repeating Petersburg reminiscences and even phrases Prince
Andrew came up stroked her hair and asked if she felt rested after
their journey She answered him and continued her chatter

The coach with six horses was waiting at the porch It was an autumn
night so dark that the coachman could not see the carriage pole
Servants with lanterns were bustling about in the porch The immense
house was brilliant with lights shining through its lofty windows The
domestic serfs were crowding in the hall waiting to bid goodby to the
young prince The members of the household were all gathered in the
reception hall Michael Ivnovich Mademoiselle Bourienne Princess
Mary and the little princess Prince Andrew had been called to his
fathers study as the latter wished to say goodby to him alone All
were waiting for them to come out

When Prince Andrew entered the study the old man in his oldage
spectacles and white dressing gown in which he received no one but his
son sat at the table writing He glanced round

Going And he went on writing

Ive come to say goodby

Kiss me here and he touched his cheek Thanks thanks

What do you thank me for

For not dillydallying and not hanging to a womans apron strings The
Service before everything Thanks thanks And he went on writing so
that his quill spluttered and squeaked If you have anything to say
say it These two things can be done together he added

About my wife I am ashamed as it is to leave her on your hands

Why talk nonsense Say what you want

When her confinement is due send to Moscow for an accoucheur Let
him be here

The old prince stopped writing and as if not understanding fixed his
stern eyes on his son

I know that no one can help if nature does not do her work said
Prince Andrew evidently confused I know that out of a million cases
only one goes wrong but it is her fancy and mine They have been
telling her things She has had a dream and is frightened

Hm Hm muttered the old prince to himself finishing what he was
writing Ill do it

He signed with a flourish and suddenly turning to his son began to
laugh

Its a bad business eh

What is bad Father

The wife said the old prince briefly and significantly

I dont understand said Prince Andrew

No it cant be helped lad said the prince Theyre all like that
one cant unmarry Dont be afraid I wont tell anyone but you know it
yourself

He seized his son by the hand with small bony fingers shook it looked
straight into his sons face with keen eyes which seemed to see through
him and again laughed his frigid laugh

The son sighed thus admitting that his father had understood him The
old man continued to fold and seal his letter snatching up and throwing
down the wax the seal and the paper with his accustomed rapidity

Whats to be done Shes pretty I will do everything Make your mind
easy said he in abrupt sentences while sealing his letter

Andrew did not speak he was both pleased and displeased that his father
understood him The old man got up and gave the letter to his son

Listen said he dont worry about your wife what can be done shall
be Now listen Give this letter to Michael Ilarinovich I have
written that he should make use of you in proper places and not keep you
long as an adjutant a bad position Tell him I remember and like him
Write and tell me how he receives you If he is all rightserve him
Nicholas Bolknskis son need not serve under anyone if he is in
disfavor Now come here

Kutzov

He spoke so rapidly that he did not finish half his words but his son
was accustomed to understand him He led him to the desk raised the
lid drew out a drawer and took out an exercise book filled with his
bold tall close handwriting

I shall probably die before you So remember these are my memoirs
hand them to the Emperor after my death Now here is a Lombard bond and
a letter it is a premium for the man who writes a history of Suvrovs
wars Send it to the Academy Here are some jottings for you to read
when I am gone You will find them useful

Andrew did not tell his father that he would no doubt live a long time
yet He felt that he must not say it

I will do it all Father he said

Well now goodby He gave his son his hand to kiss and embraced
him Remember this Prince Andrew if they kill you it will hurt me
your old father he paused unexpectedly and then in a querulous
voice suddenly shrieked but if I hear that you have not behaved like a
son of Nicholas Bolknski I shall be ashamed

You need not have said that to me Father said the son with a smile

The old man was silent

I also wanted to ask you continued Prince Andrew if Im killed and
if I have a son do not let him be taken away from youas I said
yesterday let him grow up with you Please

Not let the wife have him said the old man and laughed

They stood silent facing one another The old mans sharp eyes were
fixed straight on his sons Something twitched in the lower part of the
old princes face

Weve said goodby Go he suddenly shouted in a loud angry voice
opening his door

What is it What asked both princesses when they saw for a moment at
the door Prince Andrew and the figure of the old man in a white dressing
gown spectacled and wigless shouting in an angry voice

Prince Andrew sighed and made no reply

Well he said turning to his wife

And this Well sounded coldly ironic as if he were saying Now go
through your performance

Andrew already said the little princess turning pale and looking
with dismay at her husband

He embraced her She screamed and fell unconscious on his shoulder

He cautiously released the shoulder she leaned on looked into her face
and carefully placed her in an easy chair

Adieu Mary said he gently to his sister taking her by the hand and
kissing her and then he left the room with rapid steps

The little princess lay in the armchair Mademoiselle Bourienne chafing
her temples Princess Mary supporting her sisterinlaw still looked
with her beautiful eyes full of tears at the door through which Prince
Andrew had gone and made the sign of the cross in his direction From
the study like pistol shots came the frequent sound of the old man
angrily blowing his nose Hardly had Prince Andrew gone when the study
door opened quickly and the stern figure of the old man in the white
dressing gown looked out

Gone Thats all right said he and looking angrily at the
unconscious little princess he shook his head reprovingly and slammed
the door





BOOK TWO 1805





CHAPTER I

In October 1805 a Russian army was occupying the villages and towns of
the Archduchy of Austria and yet other regiments freshly arriving from
Russia were settling near the fortress of Braunau and burdening the
inhabitants on whom they were quartered Braunau was the headquarters of
the commanderinchief Kutzov

On October 11 1805 one of the infantry regiments that had just reached
Braunau had halted half a mile from the town waiting to be inspected by
the commanderinchief Despite the unRussian appearance of the
locality and surroundingsfruit gardens stone fences tiled roofs and
hills in the distanceand despite the fact that the inhabitants who
gazed with curiosity at the soldiers were not Russians the regiment
had just the appearance of any Russian regiment preparing for an
inspection anywhere in the heart of Russia

On the evening of the last days march an order had been received that
the commanderinchief would inspect the regiment on the march Though
the words of the order were not clear to the regimental commander and
the question arose whether the troops were to be in marching order or
not it was decided at a consultation between the battalion commanders
to present the regiment in parade order on the principle that it is
always better to bow too low than not bow low enough So the soldiers
after a twentymile march were kept mending and cleaning all night long
without closing their eyes while the adjutants and company commanders
calculated and reckoned and by morning the regimentinstead of the
straggling disorderly crowd it had been on its last march the day
beforepresented a wellordered array of two thousand men each of whom
knew his place and his duty had every button and every strap in place
and shone with cleanliness And not only externally was all in order
but had it pleased the commanderinchief to look under the uniforms he
would have found on every man a clean shirt and in every knapsack the
appointed number of articles awl soap and all as the soldiers say
There was only one circumstance concerning which no one could be at
ease It was the state of the soldiers boots More than half the mens
boots were in holes But this defect was not due to any fault of the
regimental commander for in spite of repeated demands boots had not
been issued by the Austrian commissariat and the regiment had marched
some seven hundred miles

The commander of the regiment was an elderly choleric stout and
thickset general with grizzled eyebrows and whiskers and wider from
chest to back than across the shoulders He had on a brandnew uniform
showing the creases where it had been folded and thick gold epaulettes
which seemed to stand rather than lie down on his massive shoulders He
had the air of a man happily performing one of the most solemn duties of
his life He walked about in front of the line and at every step pulled
himself up slightly arching his back It was plain that the commander
admired his regiment rejoiced in it and that his whole mind was
engrossed by it yet his strut seemed to indicate that besides military
matters social interests and the fair sex occupied no small part of his
thoughts

Well Michael Mtrich sir he said addressing one of the battalion
commanders who smilingly pressed forward it was plain that they both
felt happy We had our hands full last night However I think the
regiment is not a bad one eh

The battalion commander perceived the jovial irony and laughed

It would not be turned off the field even on the Tsartsin Meadow

What asked the commander

At that moment on the road from the town on which signalers had been
posted two men appeared on horse back They were an aidedecamp
followed by a Cossack

The aidedecamp was sent to confirm the order which had not been
clearly worded the day before namely that the commanderinchief
wished to see the regiment just in the state in which it had been on the
march in their greatcoats and packs and without any preparation
whatever

A member of the Hofkriegsrath from Vienna had come to Kutzov the day
before with proposals and demands for him to join up with the army of
the Archduke Ferdinand and Mack and Kutzov not considering this
junction advisable meant among other arguments in support of his view
to show the Austrian general the wretched state in which the troops
arrived from Russia With this object he intended to meet the regiment
so the worse the condition it was in the better pleased the commander
inchief would be Though the aidedecamp did not know these
circumstances he nevertheless delivered the definite order that the men
should be in their greatcoats and in marching order and that the
commanderinchief would otherwise be dissatisfied On hearing this the
regimental commander hung his head silently shrugged his shoulders and
spread out his arms with a choleric gesture

A fine mess weve made of it he remarked

There now Didnt I tell you Michael Mtrich that if it was said on
the march it meant in greatcoats said he reproachfully to the
battalion commander Oh my God he added stepping resolutely
forward Company commanders he shouted in a voice accustomed to
command Sergeants major How soon will he be here he asked the
aidedecamp with a respectful politeness evidently relating to the
personage he was referring to

In an hours time I should say

Shall we have time to change clothes

I dont know General

The regimental commander going up to the line himself ordered the
soldiers to change into their greatcoats The company commanders ran off
to their companies the sergeants major began bustling the greatcoats
were not in very good condition and instantly the squares that had up
to then been in regular order and silent began to sway and stretch and
hum with voices On all sides soldiers were running to and fro throwing
up their knapsacks with a jerk of their shoulders and pulling the straps
over their heads unstrapping their overcoats and drawing the sleeves on
with upraised arms

In half an hour all was again in order only the squares had become gray
instead of black The regimental commander walked with his jerky steps
to the front of the regiment and examined it from a distance

Whatever is this This he shouted and stood still Commander of the
third company

Commander of the third company wanted by the general commander to
the general third company to the commander The words passed along
the lines and an adjutant ran to look for the missing officer

When the eager but misrepeated words had reached their destination in a
cry of The general to the third company the missing officer appeared
from behind his company and though he was a middleaged man and not in
the habit of running trotted awkwardly stumbling on his toes toward the
general The captains face showed the uneasiness of a schoolboy who is
told to repeat a lesson he has not learned Spots appeared on his nose
the redness of which was evidently due to intemperance and his mouth
twitched nervously The general looked the captain up and down as he
came up panting slackening his pace as he approached

You will soon be dressing your men in petticoats What is this
shouted the regimental commander thrusting forward his jaw and pointing
at a soldier in the ranks of the third company in a greatcoat of bluish
cloth which contrasted with the others What have you been after The
commander in chief is expected and you leave your place Eh Ill teach
you to dress the men in fancy coats for a parade Eh

The commander of the company with his eyes fixed on his superior
pressed two fingers more and more rigidly to his cap as if in this
pressure lay his only hope of salvation

Well why dont you speak Whom have you got there dressed up as a
Hungarian said the commander with an austere gibe

Your excellency

Well your excellency what Your excellency But what about your
excellency nobody knows

Your excellency its the officer Dlokhov who has been reduced to the
ranks said the captain softly

Well Has he been degraded into a field marshal or into a soldier If
a soldier he should be dressed in regulation uniform like the others

Your excellency you gave him leave yourself on the march

Gave him leave Leave Thats just like you young men said the
regimental commander cooling down a little Leave indeed One says a
word to you and you What he added with renewed irritation I beg
you to dress your men decently

And the commander turning to look at the adjutant directed his jerky
steps down the line He was evidently pleased at his own display of
anger and walking up to the regiment wished to find a further excuse for
wrath Having snapped at an officer for an unpolished badge at another
because his line was not straight he reached the third company

Hoow are you standing Wheres your leg Your leg shouted the
commander with a tone of suffering in his voice while there were still
five men between him and Dlokhov with his bluishgray uniform

Dlokhov slowly straightened his bent knee looking straight with his
clear insolent eyes in the generals face

Why a blue coat Off with it Sergeant major Change his coat the
ras he did not finish

General I must obey orders but I am not bound to endure Dlokhov
hurriedly interrupted

No talking in the ranks No talking no talking

Not bound to endure insults Dlokhov concluded in loud ringing
tones

The eyes of the general and the soldier met The general became silent
angrily pulling down his tight scarf

I request you to have the goodness to change your coat he said as he
turned away





CHAPTER II

Hes coming shouted the signaler at that moment

The regimental commander flushing ran to his horse seized the stirrup
with trembling hands threw his body across the saddle righted himself
drew his saber and with a happy and resolute countenance opening his
mouth awry prepared to shout The regiment fluttered like a bird
preening its plumage and became motionless

Attention shouted the regimental commander in a soulshaking voice
which expressed joy for himself severity for the regiment and welcome
for the approaching chief

Along the broad country road edged on both sides by trees came a high
light blue Viennese calche slightly creaking on its springs and drawn
by six horses at a smart trot Behind the calche galloped the suite and
a convoy of Croats Beside Kutzov sat an Austrian general in a white
uniform that looked strange among the Russian black ones The calche
stopped in front of the regiment Kutzov and the Austrian general were
talking in low voices and Kutzov smiled slightly as treading heavily he
stepped down from the carriage just as if those two thousand men
breathlessly gazing at him and the regimental commander did not exist

The word of command rang out and again the regiment quivered as with a
jingling sound it presented arms Then amidst a dead silence the feeble
voice of the commanderinchief was heard The regiment roared Health
to your ex len len lency and again all became silent At
first Kutzov stood still while the regiment moved then he and the
general in white accompanied by the suite walked between the ranks

From the way the regimental commander saluted the commanderinchief and
devoured him with his eyes drawing himself up obsequiously and from
the way he walked through the ranks behind the generals bending forward
and hardly able to restrain his jerky movements and from the way he
darted forward at every word or gesture of the commanderinchief it
was evident that he performed his duty as a subordinate with even
greater zeal than his duty as a commander Thanks to the strictness and
assiduity of its commander the regiment in comparison with others that
had reached Braunau at the same time was in splendid condition There
were only 217 sick and stragglers Everything was in good order except
the boots

Kutzov walked through the ranks sometimes stopping to say a few
friendly words to officers he had known in the Turkish war sometimes
also to the soldiers Looking at their boots he several times shook his
head sadly pointing them out to the Austrian general with an expression
which seemed to say that he was not blaming anyone but could not help
noticing what a bad state of things it was The regimental commander ran
forward on each such occasion fearing to miss a single word of the
commanderinchiefs regarding the regiment Behind Kutzov at a
distance that allowed every softly spoken word to be heard followed
some twenty men of his suite These gentlemen talked among themselves
and sometimes laughed Nearest of all to the commanderinchief walked a
handsome adjutant This was Prince Bolknski Beside him was his comrade
Nesvtski a tall staff officer extremely stout with a kindly
smiling handsome face and moist eyes Nesvtski could hardly keep from
laughter provoked by a swarthy hussar officer who walked beside him
This hussar with a grave face and without a smile or a change in the
expression of his fixed eyes watched the regimental commanders back
and mimicked his every movement Each time the commander started and
bent forward the hussar started and bent forward in exactly the same
manner Nesvtski laughed and nudged the others to make them look at the
wag

Kutzov walked slowly and languidly past thousands of eyes which were
starting from their sockets to watch their chief On reaching the third
company he suddenly stopped His suite not having expected this
involuntarily came closer to him

Ah Timkhin said he recognizing the rednosed captain who had been
reprimanded on account of the blue greatcoat

One would have thought it impossible for a man to stretch himself more
than Timkhin had done when he was reprimanded by the regimental
commander but now that the commanderinchief addressed him he drew
himself up to such an extent that it seemed he could not have sustained
it had the commanderinchief continued to look at him and so Kutzov
who evidently understood his case and wished him nothing but good
quickly turned away a scarcely perceptible smile flitting over his
scarred and puffy face

Another Ismail comrade said he A brave officer Are you satisfied
with him he asked the regimental commander

And the latterunconscious that he was being reflected in the hussar
officer as in a looking glassstarted moved forward and answered
Highly satisfied your excellency

We all have our weaknesses said Kutzov smiling and walking away from
him He used to have a predilection for Bacchus

The regimental commander was afraid he might be blamed for this and did
not answer The hussar at that moment noticed the face of the rednosed
captain and his drawnin stomach and mimicked his expression and pose
with such exactitude that Nesvtski could not help laughing Kutzov
turned round The officer evidently had complete control of his face
and while Kutzov was turning managed to make a grimace and then assume
a most serious deferential and innocent expression

The third company was the last and Kutzov pondered apparently trying
to recollect something Prince Andrew stepped forward from among the
suite and said in French

You told me to remind you of the officer Dlokhov reduced to the ranks
in this regiment

Where is Dlokhov asked Kutzov

Dlokhov who had already changed into a soldiers gray greatcoat did
not wait to be called The shapely figure of the fairhaired soldier
with his clear blue eyes stepped forward from the ranks went up to the
commander in chief and presented arms

Have you a complaint to make Kutzov asked with a slight frown

This is Dlokhov said Prince Andrew

Ah said Kutzov I hope this will be a lesson to you Do your duty
The Emperor is gracious and I shant forget you if you deserve well

The clear blue eyes looked at the commanderinchief just as boldly as
they had looked at the regimental commander seeming by their expression
to tear open the veil of convention that separates a commanderinchief
so widely from a private

One thing I ask of your excellency Dlokhov said in his firm
ringing deliberate voice I ask an opportunity to atone for my fault
and prove my devotion to His Majesty the Emperor and to Russia

Kutzov turned away The same smile of the eyes with which he had turned
from Captain Timkhin again flitted over his face He turned away with a
grimace as if to say that everything Dlokhov had said to him and
everything he could say had long been known to him that he was weary of
it and it was not at all what he wanted He turned away and went to the
carriage

The regiment broke up into companies which went to their appointed
quarters near Braunau where they hoped to receive boots and clothes and
to rest after their hard marches

You wont bear me a grudge Prokhor Ignatych said the regimental
commander overtaking the third company on its way to its quarters and
riding up to Captain Timkhin who was walking in front The regimental
commanders face now that the inspection was happily over beamed with
irrepressible delight Its in the Emperors service it cant be
helped one is sometimes a bit hasty on parade I am the first to
apologize you know me He was very pleased And he held out his
hand to the captain

Dont mention it General as if Id be so bold replied the captain
his nose growing redder as he gave a smile which showed where two front
teeth were missing that had been knocked out by the butt end of a gun at
Ismail

And tell Mr Dlokhov that I wont forget himhe may be quite easy And
tell me pleaseIve been meaning to askhow is he behaving himself and
in general

As far as the service goes he is quite punctilious your excellency
but his character said Timkhin

And what about his character asked the regimental commander

Its different on different days answered the captain One day he is
sensible well educated and goodnatured and the next hes a wild
beast In Poland if you please he nearly killed a Jew

Oh well well remarked the regimental commander Still one must
have pity on a young man in misfortune You know he has important
connections Well then you just

I will your excellency said Timkhin showing by his smile that he
understood his commanders wish

Well of course of course

The regimental commander sought out Dlokhov in the ranks and reining
in his horse said to him

After the next affair epaulettes

Dlokhov looked round but did not say anything nor did the mocking
smile on his lips change

Well thats all right continued the regimental commander A cup of
vodka for the men from me he added so that the soldiers could hear I
thank you all God be praised and he rode past that company and
overtook the next one

Well hes really a good fellow one can serve under him said
Timkhin to the subaltern beside him

In a word a hearty one said the subaltern laughing the
regimental commander was nicknamed King of Hearts

The cheerful mood of their officers after the inspection infected the
soldiers The company marched on gaily The soldiers voices could be
heard on every side

And they said Kutzov was blind of one eye

And so he is Quite blind

No friend he is sharpereyed than you are Boots and leg bands he
noticed everything

When he looked at my feet friend well thinks I

And that other one with him the Austrian looked as if he were smeared
with chalkas white as flour I suppose they polish him up as they do
the guns

I say Fedeshon Did he say when the battles are to begin You were
near him Everybody said that Buonaparte himself was at Braunau

Buonaparte himself Just listen to the fool what he doesnt know
The Prussians are up in arms now The Austrians you see are putting
them down When theyve been put down the war with Buonaparte will
begin And he says Buonaparte is in Braunau Shows youre a fool Youd
better listen more carefully

What devils these quartermasters are See the fifth company is turning
into the village already they will have their buckwheat cooked before
we reach our quarters

Give me a biscuit you devil

And did you give me tobacco yesterday Thats just it friend Ah
well never mind here you are

They might call a halt here or well have to do another four miles
without eating

Wasnt it fine when those Germans gave us lifts You just sit still and
are drawn along

And here friend the people are quite beggarly There they all seemed
to be Polesall under the Russian crownbut here theyre all regular
Germans

Singers to the front came the captains order

And from the different ranks some twenty men ran to the front A
drummer their leader turned round facing the singers and flourishing
his arm began a longdrawnout soldiers song commencing with the
words Morning dawned the sun was rising and concluding On then
brothers on to glory led by Father Kamenski This song had been
composed in the Turkish campaign and now being sung in Austria the only
change being that the words Father Kamenski were replaced by Father
Kutzov

Having jerked out these last words as soldiers do and waved his arms as
if flinging something to the ground the drummera lean handsome
soldier of fortylooked sternly at the singers and screwed up his eyes
Then having satisfied himself that all eyes were fixed on him he raised
both arms as if carefully lifting some invisible but precious object
above his head and holding it there for some seconds suddenly flung it
down and began

Oh my bower oh my bower

Oh my bower new chimed in twenty voices and the castanet player
in spite of the burden of his equipment rushed out to the front and
walking backwards before the company jerked his shoulders and
flourished his castanets as if threatening someone The soldiers
swinging their arms and keeping time spontaneously marched with long
steps Behind the company the sound of wheels the creaking of springs
and the tramp of horses hoofs were heard Kutzov and his suite were
returning to the town The commanderinchief made a sign that the men
should continue to march at ease and he and all his suite showed
pleasure at the sound of the singing and the sight of the dancing
soldier and the gay and smartly marching men In the second file from
the right flank beside which the carriage passed the company a blue
eyed soldier involuntarily attracted notice It was Dlokhov marching
with particular grace and boldness in time to the song and looking at
those driving past as if he pitied all who were not at that moment
marching with the company The hussar cornet of Kutzovs suite who had
mimicked the regimental commander fell back from the carriage and rode
up to Dlokhov

Hussar cornet Zherkov had at one time in Petersburg belonged to the
wild set led by Dlokhov Zherkov had met Dlokhov abroad as a private
and had not seen fit to recognize him But now that Kutzov had spoken
to the gentleman ranker he addressed him with the cordiality of an old
friend

My dear fellow how are you said he through the singing making his
horse keep pace with the company

How am I Dlokhov answered coldly I am as you see

The lively song gave a special flavor to the tone of free and easy
gaiety with which Zherkov spoke and to the intentional coldness of
Dlokhovs reply

And how do you get on with the officers inquired Zherkov

All right They are good fellows And how have you wriggled onto the
staff

I was attached Im on duty

Both were silent

She let the hawk fly upward from her wide right sleeve went the song
arousing an involuntary sensation of courage and cheerfulness Their
conversation would probably have been different but for the effect of
that song

Is it true that Austrians have been beaten asked Dlokhov

The devil only knows They say so

Im glad answered Dlokhov briefly and clearly as the song demanded

I say come round some evening and well have a game of faro said
Zherkov

Why have you too much money

Do come

I cant Ive sworn not to I wont drink and wont play till I get
reinstated

Well thats only till the first engagement

We shall see

They were again silent

Come if you need anything One can at least be of use on the staff

Dlokhov smiled Dont trouble If I want anything I wont begIll
take it

Well never mind I only

And I only

Goodbye

Good health

Its a long long way To my native land

Zherkov touched his horse with the spurs it pranced excitedly from foot
to foot uncertain with which to start then settled down galloped past
the company and overtook the carriage still keeping time to the song





CHAPTER III

On returning from the review Kutzov took the Austrian general into his
private room and calling his adjutant asked for some papers relating
to the condition of the troops on their arrival and the letters that
had come from the Archduke Ferdinand who was in command of the advanced
army Prince Andrew Bolknski came into the room with the required
papers Kutzov and the Austrian member of the Hofkriegsrath were
sitting at the table on which a plan was spread out

Ah said Kutzov glancing at Bolknski as if by this exclamation he
was asking the adjutant to wait and he went on with the conversation in
French

All I can say General said he with a pleasant elegance of expression
and intonation that obliged one to listen to each deliberately spoken
word It was evident that Kutzov himself listened with pleasure to his
own voice All I can say General is that if the matter depended on my
personal wishes the will of His Majesty the Emperor Francis would have
been fulfilled long ago I should long ago have joined the archduke And
believe me on my honour that to me personally it would be a pleasure to
hand over the supreme command of the army into the hands of a better
informed and more skillful generalof whom Austria has so manyand to
lay down all this heavy responsibility But circumstances are sometimes
too strong for us General

And Kutzov smiled in a way that seemed to say You are quite at
liberty not to believe me and I dont even care whether you do or not
but you have no grounds for telling me so And that is the whole point

The Austrian general looked dissatisfied but had no option but to reply
in the same tone

On the contrary he said in a querulous and angry tone that
contrasted with his flattering words on the contrary your
excellencys participation in the common action is highly valued by His
Majesty but we think the present delay is depriving the splendid
Russian troops and their commander of the laurels they have been
accustomed to win in their battles he concluded his evidently
prearranged sentence

Kutzov bowed with the same smile

But that is my conviction and judging by the last letter with which
His Highness the Archduke Ferdinand has honored me I imagine that the
Austrian troops under the direction of so skillful a leader as General
Mack have by now already gained a decisive victory and no longer need
our aid said Kutzov

The general frowned Though there was no definite news of an Austrian
defeat there were many circumstances confirming the unfavorable rumors
that were afloat and so Kutzovs suggestion of an Austrian victory
sounded much like irony But Kutzov went on blandly smiling with the
same expression which seemed to say that he had a right to suppose so
And in fact the last letter he had received from Macks army informed
him of a victory and stated strategically the position of the army was
very favorable

Give me that letter said Kutzov turning to Prince Andrew Please
have a look at itand Kutzov with an ironical smile about the corners
of his mouth read to the Austrian general the following passage in
German from the Archduke Ferdinands letter

We have fully concentrated forces of nearly seventy thousand men with
which to attack and defeat the enemy should he cross the Lech Also as
we are masters of Ulm we cannot be deprived of the advantage of
commanding both sides of the Danube so that should the enemy not cross
the Lech we can cross the Danube throw ourselves on his line of
communications recross the river lower down and frustrate his
intention should he try to direct his whole force against our faithful
ally We shall therefore confidently await the moment when the Imperial
Russian army will be fully equipped and shall then in conjunction with
it easily find a way to prepare for the enemy the fate he deserves

Kutzov sighed deeply on finishing this paragraph and looked at the
member of the Hofkriegsrath mildly and attentively

But you know the wise maxim your excellency advising one to expect the
worst said the Austrian general evidently wishing to have done with
jests and to come to business He involuntarily looked round at the
aidedecamp

Excuse me General interrupted Kutzov also turning to Prince
Andrew Look here my dear fellow get from Kozlovski all the reports
from our scouts Here are two letters from Count Nostitz and here is one
from His Highness the Archduke Ferdinand and here are these he said
handing him several papers make a neat memorandum in French out of all
this showing all the news we have had of the movements of the Austrian
army and then give it to his excellency

Prince Andrew bowed his head in token of having understood from the
first not only what had been said but also what Kutzov would have liked
to tell him He gathered up the papers and with a bow to both stepped
softly over the carpet and went out into the waiting room

Though not much time had passed since Prince Andrew had left Russia he
had changed greatly during that period In the expression of his face
in his movements in his walk scarcely a trace was left of his former
affected languor and indolence He now looked like a man who has time to
think of the impression he makes on others but is occupied with
agreeable and interesting work His face expressed more satisfaction
with himself and those around him his smile and glance were brighter
and more attractive

Kutzov whom he had overtaken in Poland had received him very kindly
promised not to forget him distinguished him above the other adjutants
and had taken him to Vienna and given him the more serious commissions
From Vienna Kutzov wrote to his old comrade Prince Andrews father

Your son bids fair to become an officer distinguished by his industry
firmness and expedition I consider myself fortunate to have such a
subordinate by me

On Kutzovs staff among his fellow officers and in the army generally
Prince Andrew had as he had had in Petersburg society two quite
opposite reputations Some a minority acknowledged him to be different
from themselves and from everyone else expected great things of him
listened to him admired and imitated him and with them Prince Andrew
was natural and pleasant Others the majority disliked him and
considered him conceited cold and disagreeable But among these people
Prince Andrew knew how to take his stand so that they respected and even
feared him

Coming out of Kutzovs room into the waiting room with the papers in
his hand Prince Andrew came up to his comrade the aidedecamp on duty
Kozlovski who was sitting at the window with a book

Well Prince asked Kozlovski

I am ordered to write a memorandum explaining why we are not
advancing

And why is it

Prince Andrew shrugged his shoulders

Any news from Mack

No

If it were true that he has been beaten news would have come

Probably said Prince Andrew moving toward the outer door

But at that instant a tall Austrian general in a greatcoat with the
order of Maria Theresa on his neck and a black bandage round his head
who had evidently just arrived entered quickly slamming the door
Prince Andrew stopped short

Commander in Chief Kutzov said the newly arrived general speaking
quickly with a harsh German accent looking to both sides and advancing
straight toward the inner door

The commanderinchief is engaged said Kozlovski going hurriedly up
to the unknown general and blocking his way to the door Whom shall I
announce

The unknown general looked disdainfully down at Kozlovski who was
rather short as if surprised that anyone should not know him

The commanderinchief is engaged repeated Kozlovski calmly

The generals face clouded his lips quivered and trembled He took out
a notebook hurriedly scribbled something in pencil tore out the leaf
gave it to Kozlovski stepped quickly to the window and threw himself
into a chair gazing at those in the room as if asking Why do they
look at me Then he lifted his head stretched his neck as if he
intended to say something but immediately with affected indifference
began to hum to himself producing a queer sound which immediately broke
off The door of the private room opened and Kutzov appeared in the
doorway The general with the bandaged head bent forward as though
running away from some danger and making long quick strides with his
thin legs went up to Kutzov

Vous voyez le malheureux Mack he uttered in a broken voice

Kutzovs face as he stood in the open doorway remained perfectly
immobile for a few moments Then wrinkles ran over his face like a wave
and his forehead became smooth again he bowed his head respectfully
closed his eyes silently let Mack enter his room before him and closed
the door himself behind him

The report which had been circulated that the Austrians had been beaten
and that the whole army had surrendered at Ulm proved to be correct
Within half an hour adjutants had been sent in various directions with
orders which showed that the Russian troops who had hitherto been
inactive would also soon have to meet the enemy

Prince Andrew was one of those rare staff officers whose chief interest
lay in the general progress of the war When he saw Mack and heard the
details of his disaster he understood that half the campaign was lost
understood all the difficulties of the Russian armys position and
vividly imagined what awaited it and the part he would have to play
Involuntarily he felt a joyful agitation at the thought of the
humiliation of arrogant Austria and that in a weeks time he might
perhaps see and take part in the first Russian encounter with the
French since Suvrov met them He feared that Bonapartes genius might
outweigh all the courage of the Russian troops and at the same time
could not admit the idea of his hero being disgraced

Excited and irritated by these thoughts Prince Andrew went toward his
room to write to his father to whom he wrote every day In the corridor
he met Nesvtski with whom he shared a room and the wag Zherkov they
were as usual laughing

Why are you so glum asked Nesvtski noticing Prince Andrews pale
face and glittering eyes

Theres nothing to be gay about answered Bolknski

Just as Prince Andrew met Nesvtski and Zherkov there came toward them
from the other end of the corridor Strauch an Austrian general who on
Kutzovs staff in charge of the provisioning of the Russian army and
the member of the Hofkriegsrath who had arrived the previous evening
There was room enough in the wide corridor for the generals to pass the
three officers quite easily but Zherkov pushing Nesvtski aside with
his arm said in a breathless voice

Theyre coming theyre coming Stand aside make way please
make way

The generals were passing by looking as if they wished to avoid
embarrassing attentions On the face of the wag Zherkov there suddenly
appeared a stupid smile of glee which he seemed unable to suppress

Your excellency said he in German stepping forward and addressing
the Austrian general I have the honor to congratulate you

He bowed his head and scraped first with one foot and then with the
other awkwardly like a child at a dancing lesson

The member of the Hofkriegsrath looked at him severely but seeing the
seriousness of his stupid smile could not but give him a moments
attention He screwed up his eyes showing that he was listening

I have the honor to congratulate you General Mack has arrived quite
well only a little bruised just here he added pointing with a
beaming smile to his head

The general frowned turned away and went on

Gott wie naiv said he angrily after he had gone a few steps

 Good God what simplicity

Nesvtski with a laugh threw his arms round Prince Andrew but
Bolknski turning still paler pushed him away with an angry look and
turned to Zherkov The nervous irritation aroused by the appearance of
Mack the news of his defeat and the thought of what lay before the
Russian army found vent in anger at Zherkovs untimely jest

If you sir choose to make a buffoon of yourself he said sharply
with a slight trembling of the lower jaw I cant prevent your doing
so but I warn you that if you dare to play the fool in my presence I
will teach you to behave yourself

Nesvtski and Zherkov were so surprised by this outburst that they gazed
at Bolknski silently with wideopen eyes

Whats the matter I only congratulated them said Zherkov

I am not jesting with you please be silent cried Bolknski and
taking Nesvtskis arm he left Zherkov who did not know what to say

Come whats the matter old fellow said Nesvtski trying to soothe
him

Whats the matter exclaimed Prince Andrew standing still in his
excitement Dont you understand that either we are officers serving
our Tsar and our country rejoicing in the successes and grieving at the
misfortunes of our common cause or we are merely lackeys who care
nothing for their masters business Quarante mille hommes massacres et
larmee de nos allies detruite et vous trouvez la le mot pour rire
he said as if strengthening his views by this French sentence Cest
bien pour un garcon de rien comme cet individu dont vous avez fait un
ami mais pas pour vous pas pour vous 2 Only a hobbledehoy could
amuse himself in this way he added in Russianbut pronouncing the word
with a French accenthaving noticed that Zherkov could still hear him

 Forty thousand men massacred and the army of our allies destroyed
and you find that a cause for jesting

 2 It is all very well for that goodfornothing fellow of whom you
have made a friend but not for you not for you

He waited a moment to see whether the cornet would answer but he turned
and went out of the corridor





CHAPTER IV

The Pvlograd Hussars were stationed two miles from Braunau The
squadron in which Nicholas Rostv served as a cadet was quartered in the
German village of Salzeneck The best quarters in the village were
assigned to cavalrycaptain Denisov the squadron commander known
throughout the whole cavalry division as Vaska Denisov Cadet Rostv
ever since he had overtaken the regiment in Poland had lived with the
squadron commander

On October 11 the day when all was astir at headquarters over the news
of Macks defeat the camp life of the officers of this squadron was
proceeding as usual Denisov who had been losing at cards all night
had not yet come home when Rostv rode back early in the morning from a
foraging expedition Rostv in his cadet uniform with a jerk to his
horse rode up to the porch swung his leg over the saddle with a supple
youthful movement stood for a moment in the stirrup as if loathe to
part from his horse and at last sprang down and called to his orderly

Ah Bondarenko dear friend said he to the hussar who rushed up
headlong to the horse Walk him up and down my dear fellow he
continued with that gay brotherly cordiality which goodhearted young
people show to everyone when they are happy

Yes your excellency answered the Ukrainian gaily tossing his head

Mind walk him up and down well

Another hussar also rushed toward the horse but Bondarenko had already
thrown the reins of the snaffle bridle over the horses head It was
evident that the cadet was liberal with his tips and that it paid to
serve him Rostv patted the horses neck and then his flank and
lingered for a moment

Splendid What a horse he will be he thought with a smile and
holding up his saber his spurs jingling he ran up the steps of the
porch His landlord who in a waistcoat and a pointed cap pitchfork in
hand was clearing manure from the cowhouse looked out and his face
immediately brightened on seeing Rostv Schon gut Morgen Schon gut
Morgen he said winking with a merry smile evidently pleased to
greet the young man

 A very good morning A very good morning

Schon fleissig said Rostv with the same gay brotherly smile which
did not leave his eager face Hoch Oestreicher Hoch Russen Kaiser
Alexander hoch 2 said he quoting words often repeated by the
German landlord

 Busy already

 2 Hurrah for the Austrians Hurrah for the Russians Hurrah for
Emperor Alexander

The German laughed came out of the cowshed pulled off his cap and
waving it above his head cried

Und die ganze Welt hoch

 And hurrah for the whole world

Rostv waved his cap above his head like the German and cried laughing
Und vivat die ganze Welt Though neither the German cleaning his
cowshed nor Rostv back with his platoon from foraging for hay had any
reason for rejoicing they looked at each other with joyful delight and
brotherly love wagged their heads in token of their mutual affection
and parted smiling the German returning to his cowshed and Rostv going
to the cottage he occupied with Denisov

What about your master he asked Lavrushka Denisovs orderly whom
all the regiment knew for a rogue

Hasnt been in since the evening Must have been losing answered
Lavrushka I know by now if he wins he comes back early to brag about
it but if he stays out till morning it means hes lost and will come
back in a rage Will you have coffee

Yes bring some

Ten minutes later Lavrushka brought the coffee Hes coming said he
Now for trouble Rostv looked out of the window and saw Denisov
coming home Denisov was a small man with a red face sparkling black
eyes and black tousled mustache and hair He wore an unfastened cloak
wide breeches hanging down in creases and a crumpled shako on the back
of his head He came up to the porch gloomily hanging his head

Lavwuska he shouted loudly and angrily take it off blockhead

Well I am taking it off replied Lavrushkas voice

Ah youre up already said Denisov entering the room

Long ago answered Rostv I have already been for the hay and have
seen Fraulein Mathilde

Weally And Ive been losing bwother I lost yesterday like a damned
fool cried Denisov not pronouncing his rs Such ill luck Such ill
luck As soon as you left it began and went on Hullo there Tea

Puckering up his face though smiling and showing his short strong
teeth he began with stubby fingers of both hands to ruffle up his thick
tangled black hair

And what devil made me go to that wat an officer nicknamed the
rat he said rubbing his forehead and whole face with both hands
Just fancy he didnt let me win a single cahd not one cahd

He took the lighted pipe that was offered to him gripped it in his
fist and tapped it on the floor making the sparks fly while he
continued to shout

He lets one win the singles and collahs it as soon as one doubles it
gives the singles and snatches the doubles

He scattered the burning tobacco smashed the pipe and threw it away
Then he remained silent for a while and all at once looked cheerfully
with his glittering black eyes at Rostv

If at least we had some women here but theres nothing foh one to do
but dwink If we could only get to fighting soon Hullo whos there
he said turning to the door as he heard a tread of heavy boots and the
clinking of spurs that came to a stop and a respectful cough

The squadron quartermaster said Lavrushka

Denisovs face puckered still more

Wetched he muttered throwing down a purse with some gold in it
Wostov deah fellow just see how much there is left and shove the
purse undah the pillow he said and went out to the quartermaster

Rostv took the money and mechanically arranging the old and new coins
in separate piles began counting them

Ah Telyanin How dye do They plucked me last night came Denisovs
voice from the next room

Where At Bykovs at the rats I knew it replied a piping voice
and Lieutenant Telyanin a small officer of the same squadron entered
the room

Rostv thrust the purse under the pillow and shook the damp little hand
which was offered him Telyanin for some reason had been transferred
from the Guards just before this campaign He behaved very well in the
regiment but was not liked Rostv especially detested him and was
unable to overcome or conceal his groundless antipathy to the man

Well young cavalryman how is my Rook behaving he asked Rook was a
young horse Telyanin had sold to Rostv

The lieutenant never looked the man he was speaking to straight in the
face his eyes continually wandered from one object to another

I saw you riding this morning he added

Oh hes all right a good horse answered Rostv though the horse
for which he had paid seven hundred rubbles was not worth half that sum
Hes begun to go a little lame on the left foreleg he added

The hoofs cracked Thats nothing Ill teach you what to do and show
you what kind of rivet to use

Yes please do said Rostv

Ill show you Ill show you Its not a secret And its a horse
youll thank me for

Then Ill have it brought round said Rostv wishing to avoid
Telyanin and he went out to give the order

In the passage Denisov with a pipe was squatting on the threshold
facing the quartermaster who was reporting to him On seeing Rostv
Denisov screwed up his face and pointing over his shoulder with his
thumb to the room where Telyanin was sitting he frowned and gave a
shudder of disgust

Ugh I dont like that fellow he said regardless of the
quartermasters presence

Rostv shrugged his shoulders as much as to say Nor do I but whats
one to do and having given his order he returned to Telyanin

Telyanin was sitting in the same indolent pose in which Rostv had left
him rubbing his small white hands

Well there certainly are disgusting people thought Rostv as he
entered

Have you told them to bring the horse asked Telyanin getting up and
looking carelessly about him

I have

Let us go ourselves I only came round to ask Denisov about yesterdays
order Have you got it Denisov

Not yet But where are you off to

I want to teach this young man how to shoe a horse said Telyanin

They went through the porch and into the stable The lieutenant
explained how to rivet the hoof and went away to his own quarters

When Rostv went back there was a bottle of vodka and a sausage on the
table Denisov was sitting there scratching with his pen on a sheet of
paper He looked gloomily in Rostvs face and said I am witing to
her

He leaned his elbows on the table with his pen in his hand and
evidently glad of a chance to say quicker in words what he wanted to
write told Rostv the contents of his letter

You see my fwiend he said we sleep when we dont love We are
childwen of the dust but one falls in love and one is a God one is
pua as on the first day of cweation Whos that now Send him to the
devil Im busy he shouted to Lavrushka who went up to him not in the
least abashed

Who should it be You yourself told him to come Its the quartermaster
for the money

Denisov frowned and was about to shout some reply but stopped

Wetched business he muttered to himself How much is left in the
puhse he asked turning to Rostv

Seven new and three old imperials

Oh its wetched Well what are you standing there for you scacwow
Call the quahtehmasteh he shouted to Lavrushka

Please Denisov let me lend you some I have some you know said
Rostv blushing

Dont like bowwowing from my own fellows I dont growled Denisov

But if you wont accept money from me like a comrade you will offend
me Really I have some Rostv repeated

No I tell you

And Denisov went to the bed to get the purse from under the pillow

Where have you put it Wostov

Under the lower pillow

Its not there

Denisov threw both pillows on the floor The purse was not there

Thats a miwacle

Wait havent you dropped it said Rostv picking up the pillows one
at a time and shaking them

He pulled off the quilt and shook it The purse was not there

Dear me can I have forgotten No I remember thinking that you kept it
under your head like a treasure said Rostv I put it just here
Where is it he asked turning to Lavrushka

I havent been in the room It must be where you put it

But it isnt

Youre always like that you thwow a thing down anywhere and forget it
Feel in your pockets

No if I hadnt thought of it being a treasure said Rostv but I
remember putting it there

Lavrushka turned all the bedding over looked under the bed and under
the table searched everywhere and stood still in the middle of the
room Denisov silently watched Lavrushkas movements and when the
latter threw up his arms in surprise saying it was nowhere to be found
Denisov glanced at Rostv

Wostov youve not been playing schoolboy twicks

Rostv felt Denisovs gaze fixed on him raised his eyes and instantly
dropped them again All the blood which had seemed congested somewhere
below his throat rushed to his face and eyes He could not draw breath

And there hasnt been anyone in the room except the lieutenant and
yourselves It must be here somewhere said Lavrushka

Now then you devils puppet look alive and hunt for it shouted
Denisov suddenly turning purple and rushing at the man with a
threatening gesture If the purse isnt found Ill flog you Ill flog
you all

Rostv his eyes avoiding Denisov began buttoning his coat buckled on
his saber and put on his cap

I must have that purse I tell you shouted Denisov shaking his
orderly by the shoulders and knocking him against the wall

Denisov let him alone I know who has taken it said Rostv going
toward the door without raising his eyes Denisov paused thought a
moment and evidently understanding what Rostv hinted at seized his
arm

Nonsense he cried and the veins on his forehead and neck stood out
like cords You are mad I tell you I wont allow it The purse is
here Ill flay this scoundwel alive and it will be found

I know who has taken it repeated Rostv in an unsteady voice and
went to the door

And I tell you dont you dahe to do it shouted Denisov rushing at
the cadet to restrain him

But Rostv pulled away his arm and with as much anger as though Denisov
were his worst enemy firmly fixed his eyes directly on his face

Do you understand what youre saying he said in a trembling voice
There was no one else in the room except myself So that if it is not
so then

He could not finish and ran out of the room

Ah may the devil take you and evewybody were the last words Rostv
heard

Rostv went to Telyanins quarters

The master is not in hes gone to headquarters said Telyanins
orderly Has something happened he added surprised at the cadets
troubled face

No nothing

Youve only just missed him said the orderly

The headquarters were situated two miles away from Salzeneck and
Rostv without returning home took a horse and rode there There was
an inn in the village which the officers frequented Rostv rode up to
it and saw Telyanins horse at the porch

In the second room of the inn the lieutenant was sitting over a dish of
sausages and a bottle of wine

Ah youve come here too young man he said smiling and raising his
eyebrows

Yes said Rostv as if it cost him a great deal to utter the word and
he sat down at the nearest table

Both were silent There were two Germans and a Russian officer in the
room No one spoke and the only sounds heard were the clatter of knives
and the munching of the lieutenant

When Telyanin had finished his lunch he took out of his pocket a double
purse and drawing its rings aside with his small white turnedup
fingers drew out a gold imperial and lifting his eyebrows gave it to
the waiter

Please be quick he said

The coin was a new one Rostv rose and went up to Telyanin

Allow me to look at your purse he said in a low almost inaudible
voice

With shifting eyes but eyebrows still raised Telyanin handed him the
purse

Yes its a nice purse Yes yes he said growing suddenly pale and
added Look at it young man

Rostv took the purse in his hand examined it and the money in it and
looked at Telyanin The lieutenant was looking about in his usual way
and suddenly seemed to grow very merry

If we get to Vienna Ill get rid of it there but in these wretched
little towns theres nowhere to spend it said he Well let me have
it young man Im going

Rostv did not speak

And you Are you going to have lunch too They feed you quite decently
here continued Telyanin Now then let me have it

He stretched out his hand to take hold of the purse Rostv let go of
it Telyanin took the purse and began carelessly slipping it into the
pocket of his riding breeches with his eyebrows lifted and his mouth
slightly open as if to say Yes yes I am putting my purse in my
pocket and thats quite simple and is no one elses business

Well young man he said with a sigh and from under his lifted brows
he glanced into Rostvs eyes

Some flash as of an electric spark shot from Telyanins eyes to Rostvs
and back and back again and again in an instant

Come here said Rostv catching hold of Telyanins arm and almost
dragging him to the window That money is Denisovs you took it he
whispered just above Telyanins ear

What What How dare you What said Telyanin

But these words came like a piteous despairing cry and an entreaty for
pardon As soon as Rostv heard them an enormous load of doubt fell
from him He was glad and at the same instant began to pity the
miserable man who stood before him but the task he had begun had to be
completed

Heaven only knows what the people here may imagine muttered Telyanin
taking up his cap and moving toward a small empty room We must have an
explanation

I know it and shall prove it said Rostv

I

Every muscle of Telyanins pale terrified face began to quiver his
eyes still shifted from side to side but with a downward look not rising
to Rostvs face and his sobs were audible

Count Dont ruin a young fellow here is this wretched money
take it He threw it on the table I have an old father and
mother

Rostv took the money avoiding Telyanins eyes and went out of the
room without a word But at the door he stopped and then retraced his
steps O God he said with tears in his eyes how could you do it

Count said Telyanin drawing nearer to him

Dont touch me said Rostv drawing back If you need it take the
money and he threw the purse to him and ran out of the inn





CHAPTER V

That same evening there was an animated discussion among the squadrons
officers in Denisovs quarters

And I tell you Rostv that you must apologize to the colonel said a
tall grizzlyhaired staff captain with enormous mustaches and many
wrinkles on his large features to Rostv who was crimson with
excitement

The staff captain Kirsten had twice been reduced to the ranks for
affairs of honor and had twice regained his commission

I will allow no one to call me a liar cried Rostv He told me I
lied and I told him he lied And there it rests He may keep me on duty
every day or may place me under arrest but no one can make me
apologize because if he as commander of this regiment thinks it
beneath his dignity to give me satisfaction then

You just wait a moment my dear fellow and listen interrupted the
staff captain in his deep bass calmly stroking his long mustache You
tell the colonel in the presence of other officers that an officer has
stolen

Im not to blame that the conversation began in the presence of other
officers Perhaps I ought not to have spoken before them but I am not a
diplomatist Thats why I joined the hussars thinking that here one
would not need finesse and he tells me that I am lyingso let him give
me satisfaction

Thats all right No one thinks you a coward but thats not the point
Ask Denisov whether it is not out of the question for a cadet to demand
satisfaction of his regimental commander

Denisov sat gloomily biting his mustache and listening to the
conversation evidently with no wish to take part in it He answered the
staff captains question by a disapproving shake of his head

You speak to the colonel about this nasty business before other
officers continued the staff captain and Bogdanich the colonel was
called Bogdanich shuts you up

He did not shut me up he said I was telling an untruth

Well have it so and you talked a lot of nonsense to him and must
apologize

Not on any account exclaimed Rostv

I did not expect this of you said the staff captain seriously and
severely You dont wish to apologize but man its not only to him
but to the whole regimentall of usyoure to blame all round The case
is this you ought to have thought the matter over and taken advice but
no you go and blurt it all straight out before the officers Now what
was the colonel to do Have the officer tried and disgrace the whole
regiment Disgrace the whole regiment because of one scoundrel Is that
how you look at it We dont see it like that And Bogdanich was a
brick he told you you were saying what was not true Its not pleasant
but whats to be done my dear fellow You landed yourself in it And
now when one wants to smooth the thing over some conceit prevents your
apologizing and you wish to make the whole affair public You are
offended at being put on duty a bit but why not apologize to an old and
honorable officer Whatever Bogdanich may be anyway he is an honorable
and brave old colonel Youre quick at taking offense but you dont
mind disgracing the whole regiment The staff captains voice began to
tremble You have been in the regiment next to no time my lad youre
here today and tomorrow youll be appointed adjutant somewhere and can
snap your fingers when it is said There are thieves among the Pvlograd
officers But its not all the same to us Am I not right Denisov
Its not the same

Denisov remained silent and did not move but occasionally looked with
his glittering black eyes at Rostv

You value your own pride and dont wish to apologize continued the
staff captain but we old fellows who have grown up in and God
willing are going to die in the regiment we prize the honor of the
regiment and Bogdanich knows it Oh we do prize it old fellow And
all this is not right its not right You may take offense or not but I
always stick to mother truth Its not right

And the staff captain rose and turned away from Rostv

Thats twue devil take it shouted Denisov jumping up Now then
Wostov now then

Rostv growing red and pale alternately looked first at one officer
and then at the other

No gentlemen no you mustnt think I quite understand Youre
wrong to think that of me I for me for the honor of the
regiment Id Ah well Ill show that in action and for me the honor
of the flag Well never mind its true Im to blame to blame all
round Well what else do you want

Come thats right Count cried the staff captain turning round and
clapping Rostv on the shoulder with his big hand

I tell you shouted Denisov hes a fine fellow

Thats better Count said the staff captain beginning to address
Rostv by his title as if in recognition of his confession Go and
apologize your excellency Yes go

Gentlemen Ill do anything No one shall hear a word from me said
Rostv in an imploring voice but I cant apologize by God I cant do
what you will How can I go and apologize like a little boy asking
forgiveness

Denisov began to laugh

Itll be worse for you Bogdanich is vindictive and youll pay for your
obstinacy said Kirsten

No on my word its not obstinacy I cant describe the feeling I
cant

Well its as you like said the staff captain And what has become
of that scoundrel he asked Denisov

He has weported himself sick hes to be stwuck off the list tomowwow
muttered Denisov

It is an illness theres no other way of explaining it said the
staff captain

Illness or not hed better not cwoss my path Id kill him shouted
Denisov in a bloodthirsty tone

Just then Zherkov entered the room

What brings you here cried the officers turning to the newcomer

Were to go into action gentlemen Mack has surrendered with his whole
army

Its not true

Ive seen him myself

What Saw the real Mack With hands and feet

Into action Into action Bring him a bottle for such news But how did
you come here

Ive been sent back to the regiment all on account of that devil Mack
An Austrian general complained of me I congratulated him on Macks
arrival Whats the matter Rostv You look as if youd just come out
of a hot bath

Oh my dear fellow were in such a stew here these last two days

The regimental adjutant came in and confirmed the news brought by
Zherkov They were under orders to advance next day

Were going into action gentlemen

Well thank God Weve been sitting here too long





CHAPTER VI

Kutzov fell back toward Vienna destroying behind him the bridges over
the rivers Inn at Braunau and Traun near Linz On October 23 the
Russian troops were crossing the river Enns At midday the Russian
baggage train the artillery and columns of troops were defiling
through the town of Enns on both sides of the bridge

It was a warm rainy autumnal day The wide expanse that opened out
before the heights on which the Russian batteries stood guarding the
bridge was at times veiled by a diaphanous curtain of slanting rain and
then suddenly spread out in the sunlight fardistant objects could be
clearly seen glittering as though freshly varnished Down below the
little town could be seen with its white redroofed houses its
cathedral and its bridge on both sides of which streamed jostling
masses of Russian troops At the bend of the Danube vessels an island
and a castle with a park surrounded by the waters of the confluence of
the Enns and the Danube became visible and the rocky left bank of the
Danube covered with pine forests with a mystic background of green
treetops and bluish gorges The turrets of a convent stood out beyond a
wild virgin pine forest and far away on the other side of the Enns the
enemys horse patrols could be discerned

Among the field guns on the brow of the hill the general in command of
the rearguard stood with a staff officer scanning the country through
his fieldglass A little behind them Nesvtski who had been sent to the
rearguard by the commanderinchief was sitting on the trail of a gun
carriage A Cossack who accompanied him had handed him a knapsack and a
flask and Nesvtski was treating some officers to pies and real
doppelkummel The officers gladly gathered round him some on their
knees some squatting Turkish fashion on the wet grass

Yes the Austrian prince who built that castle was no fool Its a fine
place Why are you not eating anything gentlemen Nesvtski was
saying

Thank you very much Prince answered one of the officers pleased to
be talking to a staff officer of such importance Its a lovely place
We passed close to the park and saw two deer and what a splendid
house

Look Prince said another who would have dearly liked to take
another pie but felt shy and therefore pretended to be examining the
countrysideSee our infantrymen have already got there Look there in
the meadow behind the village three of them are dragging something
Theyll ransack that castle he remarked with evident approval

So they will said Nesvtski No but what I should like added he
munching a pie in his moistlipped handsome mouth would be to slip in
over there

He pointed with a smile to a turreted nunnery and his eyes narrowed and
gleamed

That would be fine gentlemen

The officers laughed

Just to flutter the nuns a bit They say there are Italian girls among
them On my word Id give five years of my life for it

They must be feeling dull too said one of the bolder officers
laughing

Meanwhile the staff officer standing in front pointed out something to
the general who looked through his field glass

Yes so it is so it is said the general angrily lowering the field
glass and shrugging his shoulders so it is Theyll be fired on at the
crossing And why are they dawdling there

On the opposite side the enemy could be seen by the naked eye and from
their battery a milkwhite cloud arose Then came the distant report of
a shot and our troops could be seen hurrying to the crossing

Nesvtski rose puffing and went up to the general smiling

Would not your excellency like a little refreshment he said

Its a bad business said the general without answering him our men
have been wasting time

Hadnt I better ride over your excellency asked Nesvtski

Yes please do answered the general and he repeated the order that
had already once been given in detail and tell the hussars that they
are to cross last and to fire the bridge as I ordered and the
inflammable material on the bridge must be reinspected

Very good answered Nesvtski

He called the Cossack with his horse told him to put away the knapsack
and flask and swung his heavy person easily into the saddle

Ill really call in on the nuns he said to the officers who watched
him smilingly and he rode off by the winding path down the hill

Now then lets see how far it will carry Captain Just try said the
general turning to an artillery officer Have a little fun to pass the
time

Crew to your guns commanded the officer

In a moment the men came running gaily from their campfires and began
loading

One came the command

Number one jumped briskly aside The gun rang out with a deafening
metallic roar and a whistling grenade flew above the heads of our
troops below the hill and fell far short of the enemy a little smoke
showing the spot where it burst

The faces of officers and men brightened up at the sound Everyone got
up and began watching the movements of our troops below as plainly
visible as if but a stones throw away and the movements of the
approaching enemy farther off At the same instant the sun came fully
out from behind the clouds and the clear sound of the solitary shot and
the brilliance of the bright sunshine merged in a single joyous and
spirited impression





CHAPTER VII

Two of the enemys shots had already flown across the bridge where
there was a crush Halfway across stood Prince Nesvtski who had
alighted from his horse and whose big body was jammed against the
railings He looked back laughing to the Cossack who stood a few steps
behind him holding two horses by their bridles Each time Prince
Nesvtski tried to move on soldiers and carts pushed him back again and
pressed him against the railings and all he could do was to smile

What a fine fellow you are friend said the Cossack to a convoy
soldier with a wagon who was pressing onto the infantrymen who were
crowded together close to his wheels and his horses What a fellow You
cant wait a moment Dont you see the general wants to pass

But the convoyman took no notice of the word general and shouted at
the soldiers who were blocking his way Hi there boys Keep to the
left Wait a bit But the soldiers crowded together shoulder to
shoulder their bayonets interlocking moved over the bridge in a dense
mass Looking down over the rails Prince Nesvtski saw the rapid noisy
little waves of the Enns which rippling and eddying round the piles of
the bridge chased each other along Looking on the bridge he saw equally
uniform living waves of soldiers shoulder straps covered shakos
knapsacks bayonets long muskets and under the shakos faces with
broad cheekbones sunken cheeks and listless tired expressions and
feet that moved through the sticky mud that covered the planks of the
bridge Sometimes through the monotonous waves of men like a fleck of
white foam on the waves of the Enns an officer in a cloak and with a
type of face different from that of the men squeezed his way along
sometimes like a chip of wood whirling in the river an hussar on foot
an orderly or a townsman was carried through the waves of infantry and
sometimes like a log floating down the river an officers or companys
baggage wagon piled high leather covered and hemmed in on all sides
moved across the bridge

Its as if a dam had burst said the Cossack hopelessly Are there
many more of you to come

A million all but one replied a waggish soldier in a torn coat with
a wink and passed on followed by another an old man

If he he meant the enemy begins popping at the bridge now said
the old soldier dismally to a comrade youll forget to scratch
yourself

That soldier passed on and after him came another sitting on a cart

Where the devil have the leg bands been shoved to said an orderly
running behind the cart and fumbling in the back of it

And he also passed on with the wagon Then came some merry soldiers who
had evidently been drinking

And then old fellow he gives him one in the teeth with the butt end
of his gun a soldier whose greatcoat was well tucked up said gaily
with a wide swing of his arm

Yes the ham was just delicious answered another with a loud laugh
And they too passed on so that Nesvtski did not learn who had been
struck on the teeth or what the ham had to do with it

Bah How they scurry He just sends a ball and they think theyll all
be killed a sergeant was saying angrily and reproachfully

As it flies past me Daddy the ball I mean said a young soldier with
an enormous mouth hardly refraining from laughing I felt like dying
of fright I did pon my word I got that frightened said he as if
bragging of having been frightened

That one also passed Then followed a cart unlike any that had gone
before It was a German cart with a pair of horses led by a German and
seemed loaded with a whole houseful of effects A fine brindled cow with
a large udder was attached to the cart behind A woman with an unweaned
baby an old woman and a healthy German girl with bright red cheeks
were sitting on some feather beds Evidently these fugitives were
allowed to pass by special permission The eyes of all the soldiers
turned toward the women and while the vehicle was passing at foot pace
all the soldiers remarks related to the two young ones Every face bore
almost the same smile expressing unseemly thoughts about the women

Just see the German sausage is making tracks too

Sell me the missis said another soldier addressing the German who
angry and frightened strode energetically along with downcast eyes

See how smart shes made herself Oh the devils

There Fedotov you should be quartered on them

I have seen as much before now mate

Where are you going asked an infantry officer who was eating an
apple also half smiling as he looked at the handsome girl

The German closed his eyes signifying that he did not understand

Take it if you like said the officer giving the girl an apple

The girl smiled and took it Nesvtski like the rest of the men on the
bridge did not take his eyes off the women till they had passed When
they had gone by the same stream of soldiers followed with the same
kind of talk and at last all stopped As often happens the horses of a
convoy wagon became restive at the end of the bridge and the whole
crowd had to wait

And why are they stopping Theres no proper order said the soldiers
Where are you shoving to Devil take you Cant you wait Itll be
worse if he fires the bridge See heres an officer jammed in
toodifferent voices were saying in the crowd as the men looked at one
another and all pressed toward the exit from the bridge

Looking down at the waters of the Enns under the bridge Nesvtski
suddenly heard a sound new to him of something swiftly approaching
something big that splashed into the water

Just see where it carries to a soldier near by said sternly looking
round at the sound

Encouraging us to get along quicker said another uneasily

The crowd moved on again Nesvtski realized that it was a cannon ball

Hey Cossack my horse he said Now then you there get out of the
way Make way

With great difficulty he managed to get to his horse and shouting
continually he moved on The soldiers squeezed themselves to make way
for him but again pressed on him so that they jammed his leg and those
nearest him were not to blame for they were themselves pressed still
harder from behind

Nesvtski Nesvtski you numskull came a hoarse voice from behind
him

Nesvtski looked round and saw some fifteen paces away but separated by
the living mass of moving infantry Vaska Denisov red and shaggy with
his cap on the back of his black head and a cloak hanging jauntily over
his shoulder

Tell these devils these fiends to let me pass shouted Denisov
evidently in a fit of rage his coalblack eyes with their bloodshot
whites glittering and rolling as he waved his sheathed saber in a small
bare hand as red as his face

Ah Vaska joyfully replied Nesvtski Whats up with you

The squadwon cant pass shouted Vaska Denisov showing his white
teeth fiercely and spurring his black thoroughbred Arab which twitched
its ears as the bayonets touched it and snorted spurting white foam
from his bit tramping the planks of the bridge with his hoofs and
apparently ready to jump over the railings had his rider let him What
is this Theyre like sheep Just like sheep Out of the way Let us
pass Stop there you devil with the cart Ill hack you with my
saber he shouted actually drawing his saber from its scabbard and
flourishing it

The soldiers crowded against one another with terrified faces and
Denisov joined Nesvtski

Hows it youre not drunk today said Nesvtski when the other had
ridden up to him

They dont even give one time to dwink answered Vaska Denisov They
keep dwagging the wegiment to and fwo all day If they mean to fight
lets fight But the devil knows what this is

What a dandy you are today said Nesvtski looking at Denisovs new
cloak and saddlecloth

Denisov smiled took out of his sabretache a handkerchief that diffused
a smell of perfume and put it to Nesvtskis nose

Of course Im going into action Ive shaved bwushed my teeth and
scented myself

The imposing figure of Nesvtski followed by his Cossack and the
determination of Denisov who flourished his sword and shouted
frantically had such an effect that they managed to squeeze through to
the farther side of the bridge and stopped the infantry Beside the
bridge Nesvtski found the colonel to whom he had to deliver the order
and having done this he rode back

Having cleared the way Denisov stopped at the end of the bridge
Carelessly holding in his stallion that was neighing and pawing the
ground eager to rejoin its fellows he watched his squadron draw
nearer Then the clang of hoofs as of several horses galloping
resounded on the planks of the bridge and the squadron officers in
front and men four abreast spread across the bridge and began to emerge
on his side of it

The infantry who had been stopped crowded near the bridge in the
trampled mud and gazed with that particular feeling of illwill
estrangement and ridicule with which troops of different arms usually
encounter one another at the clean smart hussars who moved past them in
regular order

Smart lads Only fit for a fair said one

What good are they Theyre led about just for show remarked another

Dont kick up the dust you infantry jested an hussar whose prancing
horse had splashed mud over some foot soldiers

Id like to put you on a two days march with a knapsack Your fine
cords would soon get a bit rubbed said an infantryman wiping the mud
off his face with his sleeve Perched up there youre more like a bird
than a man

There now Zikin they ought to put you on a horse Youd look fine
said a corporal chaffing a thin little soldier who bent under the
weight of his knapsack

Take a stick between your legs thatll suit you for a horse the
hussar shouted back





CHAPTER VIII

The last of the infantry hurriedly crossed the bridge squeezing
together as they approached it as if passing through a funnel At last
the baggage wagons had all crossed the crush was less and the last
battalion came onto the bridge Only Denisovs squadron of hussars
remained on the farther side of the bridge facing the enemy who could
be seen from the hill on the opposite bank but was not yet visible from
the bridge for the horizon as seen from the valley through which the
river flowed was formed by the rising ground only half a mile away At
the foot of the hill lay wasteland over which a few groups of our
Cossack scouts were moving Suddenly on the road at the top of the high
ground artillery and troops in blue uniform were seen These were the
French A group of Cossack scouts retired down the hill at a trot All
the officers and men of Denisovs squadron though they tried to talk of
other things and to look in other directions thought only of what was
there on the hilltop and kept constantly looking at the patches
appearing on the skyline which they knew to be the enemys troops The
weather had cleared again since noon and the sun was descending brightly
upon the Danube and the dark hills around it It was calm and at
intervals the bugle calls and the shouts of the enemy could be heard
from the hill There was no one now between the squadron and the enemy
except a few scattered skirmishers An empty space of some seven hundred
yards was all that separated them The enemy ceased firing and that
stern threatening inaccessible and intangible line which separates
two hostile armies was all the more clearly felt

One step beyond that boundary line which resembles the line dividing
the living from the dead lies uncertainty suffering and death And
what is there Who is therethere beyond that field that tree that
roof lit up by the sun No one knows but one wants to know You fear
and yet long to cross that line and know that sooner or later it must
be crossed and you will have to find out what is there just as you will
inevitably have to learn what lies the other side of death But you are
strong healthy cheerful and excited and are surrounded by other such
excitedly animated and healthy men So thinks or at any rate feels
anyone who comes in sight of the enemy and that feeling gives a
particular glamour and glad keenness of impression to everything that
takes place at such moments

On the high ground where the enemy was the smoke of a cannon rose and
a ball flew whistling over the heads of the hussar squadron The
officers who had been standing together rode off to their places The
hussars began carefully aligning their horses Silence fell on the whole
squadron All were looking at the enemy in front and at the squadron
commander awaiting the word of command A second and a third cannon
ball flew past Evidently they were firing at the hussars but the balls
with rapid rhythmic whistle flew over the heads of the horsemen and fell
somewhere beyond them The hussars did not look round but at the sound
of each shot as at the word of command the whole squadron with its
rows of faces so alike yet so different holding its breath while the
ball flew past rose in the stirrups and sank back again The soldiers
without turning their heads glanced at one another curious to see their
comrades impression Every face from Denisovs to that of the bugler
showed one common expression of conflict irritation and excitement
around chin and mouth The quartermaster frowned looking at the
soldiers as if threatening to punish them Cadet Mironov ducked every
time a ball flew past Rostv on the left flank mounted on his Rooka
handsome horse despite its game leghad the happy air of a schoolboy
called up before a large audience for an examination in which he feels
sure he will distinguish himself He was glancing at everyone with a
clear bright expression as if asking them to notice how calmly he sat
under fire But despite himself on his face too that same indication of
something new and stern showed round the mouth

Whos that curtseying there Cadet Miwonov Thats not wight Look at
me cried Denisov who unable to keep still on one spot kept turning
his horse in front of the squadron

The black hairy snubnosed face of Vaska Denisov and his whole short
sturdy figure with the sinewy hairy hand and stumpy fingers in which he
held the hilt of his naked saber looked just as it usually did
especially toward evening when he had emptied his second bottle he was
only redder than usual With his shaggy head thrown back like birds when
they drink pressing his spurs mercilessly into the sides of his good
horse Bedouin and sitting as though falling backwards in the saddle
he galloped to the other flank of the squadron and shouted in a hoarse
voice to the men to look to their pistols He rode up to Kirsten The
staff captain on his broadbacked steady mare came at a walk to meet
him His face with its long mustache was serious as always only his
eyes were brighter than usual

Well what about it said he to Denisov It wont come to a fight
Youll seewe shall retire

The devil only knows what theyre about muttered Denisov Ah
Wostov he cried noticing the cadets bright face youve got it at
last

And he smiled approvingly evidently pleased with the cadet Rostv felt
perfectly happy Just then the commander appeared on the bridge Denisov
galloped up to him

Your excellency Let us attack them Ill dwive them off

Attack indeed said the colonel in a bored voice puckering up his
face as if driving off a troublesome fly And why are you stopping
here Dont you see the skirmishers are retreating Lead the squadron
back

The squadron crossed the bridge and drew out of range of fire without
having lost a single man The second squadron that had been in the front
line followed them across and the last Cossacks quitted the farther side
of the river

The two Pvlograd squadrons having crossed the bridge retired up the
hill one after the other Their colonel Karl Bogdanich Schubert came
up to Denisovs squadron and rode at a footpace not far from Rostv
without taking any notice of him although they were now meeting for the
first time since their encounter concerning Telyanin Rostv feeling
that he was at the front and in the power of a man toward whom he now
admitted that he had been to blame did not lift his eyes from the
colonels athletic back his nape covered with light hair and his red
neck It seemed to Rostv that Bogdanich was only pretending not to
notice him and that his whole aim now was to test the cadets courage
so he drew himself up and looked around him merrily then it seemed to
him that Bogdanich rode so near in order to show him his courage Next
he thought that his enemy would send the squadron on a desperate attack
just to punish himRostv Then he imagined how after the attack
Bogdanich would come up to him as he lay wounded and would magnanimously
extend the hand of reconciliation

The highshouldered figure of Zherkov familiar to the Pvlograds as he
had but recently left their regiment rode up to the colonel After his
dismissal from headquarters Zherkov had not remained in the regiment
saying he was not such a fool as to slave at the front when he could get
more rewards by doing nothing on the staff and had succeeded in
attaching himself as an orderly officer to Prince Bagration He now came
to his former chief with an order from the commander of the rear guard

Colonel he said addressing Rostvs enemy with an air of gloomy
gravity and glancing round at his comrades there is an order to stop
and fire the bridge

An order to who asked the colonel morosely

I dont myself know to who replied the cornet in a serious tone
but the prince told me to go and tell the colonel that the hussars
must return quickly and fire the bridge

Zherkov was followed by an officer of the suite who rode up to the
colonel of hussars with the same order After him the stout Nesvtski
came galloping up on a Cossack horse that could scarcely carry his
weight

Hows this Colonel he shouted as he approached I told you to fire
the bridge and now someone has gone and blundered they are all beside
themselves over there and one cant make anything out

The colonel deliberately stopped the regiment and turned to Nesvtski

You spoke to me of inflammable material said he but you said
nothing about firing it

But my dear sir said Nesvtski as he drew up taking off his cap and
smoothing his hair wet with perspiration with his plump hand wasnt I
telling you to fire the bridge when inflammable material had been put
in position

I am not your dear sir Mr Staff Officer and you did not tell me to
burn the bridge I know the service and it is my habit orders strictly
to obey You said the bridge would be burned but who would it burn I
could not know by the holy spirit

Ah thats always the way said Nesvtski with a wave of the hand
How did you get here said he turning to Zherkov

On the same business But you are damp Let me wring you out

You were saying Mr Staff Officer continued the colonel in an
offended tone

Colonel interrupted the officer of the suite You must be quick or
the enemy will bring up his guns to use grapeshot

The colonel looked silently at the officer of the suite at the stout
staff officer and at Zherkov and he frowned

I will the bridge fire he said in a solemn tone as if to announce
that in spite of all the unpleasantness he had to endure he would still
do the right thing

Striking his horse with his long muscular legs as if it were to blame
for everything the colonel moved forward and ordered the second
squadron that in which Rostv was serving under Denisov to return to
the bridge

There its just as I thought said Rostv to himself He wishes to
test me His heart contracted and the blood rushed to his face Let
him see whether I am a coward he thought

Again on all the bright faces of the squadron the serious expression
appeared that they had worn when under fire Rostv watched his enemy
the colonel closelyto find in his face confirmation of his own
conjecture but the colonel did not once glance at Rostv and looked as
he always did when at the front solemn and stern Then came the word of
command

Look sharp Look sharp several voices repeated around him

Their sabers catching in the bridles and their spurs jingling the
hussars hastily dismounted not knowing what they were to do The men
were crossing themselves Rostv no longer looked at the colonel he had
no time He was afraid of falling behind the hussars so much afraid
that his heart stood still His hand trembled as he gave his horse into
an orderlys charge and he felt the blood rush to his heart with a
thud Denisov rode past him leaning back and shouting something Rostv
saw nothing but the hussars running all around him their spurs catching
and their sabers clattering

Stretchers shouted someone behind him

Rostv did not think what this call for stretchers meant he ran on
trying only to be ahead of the others but just at the bridge not
looking at the ground he came on some sticky trodden mud stumbled
and fell on his hands The others outstripped him

At boss zides Captain he heard the voice of the colonel who having
ridden ahead had pulled up his horse near the bridge with a
triumphant cheerful face

Rostv wiping his muddy hands on his breeches looked at his enemy and
was about to run on thinking that the farther he went to the front the
better But Bogdanich without looking at or recognizing Rostv shouted
to him

Whos that running on the middle of the bridge To the right Come
back Cadet he cried angrily and turning to Denisov who showing off
his courage had ridden on to the planks of the bridge

Why run risks Captain You should dismount he said

Oh every bullet has its billet answered Vaska Denisov turning in
his saddle

Meanwhile Nesvtski Zherkov and the officer of the suite were standing
together out of range of the shots watching now the small group of men
with yellow shakos darkgreen jackets braided with cord and blue
riding breeches who were swarming near the bridge and then at what was
approaching in the distance from the opposite sidethe blue uniforms and
groups with horses easily recognizable as artillery

Will they burn the bridge or not Wholl get there first Will they get
there and fire the bridge or will the French get within grapeshot range
and wipe them out These were the questions each man of the troops on
the high ground above the bridge involuntarily asked himself with a
sinking heartwatching the bridge and the hussars in the bright evening
light and the blue tunics advancing from the other side with their
bayonets and guns

Ugh The hussars will get it hot said Nesvtski they are within
grapeshot range now

He shouldnt have taken so many men said the officer of the suite

True enough answered Nesvtski two smart fellows could have done
the job just as well

Ah your excellency put in Zherkov his eyes fixed on the hussars
but still with that nave air that made it impossible to know whether he
was speaking in jest or in earnest Ah your excellency How you look
at things Send two men And who then would give us the Vladimir medal
and ribbon But now even if they do get peppered the squadron may be
recommended for honors and he may get a ribbon Our Bogdanich knows how
things are done

There now said the officer of the suite thats grapeshot

He pointed to the French guns the limbers of which were being detached
and hurriedly removed

On the French side amid the groups with cannon a cloud of smoke
appeared then a second and a third almost simultaneously and at the
moment when the first report was heard a fourth was seen Then two
reports one after another and a third

Oh Oh groaned Nesvtski as if in fierce pain seizing the officer of
the suite by the arm Look A man has fallen Fallen fallen

Two I think

If I were Tsar I would never go to war said Nesvtski turning away

The French guns were hastily reloaded The infantry in their blue
uniforms advanced toward the bridge at a run Smoke appeared again but
at irregular intervals and grapeshot cracked and rattled onto the
bridge But this time Nesvtski could not see what was happening there
as a dense cloud of smoke arose from it The hussars had succeeded in
setting it on fire and the French batteries were now firing at them no
longer to hinder them but because the guns were trained and there was
someone to fire at

The French had time to fire three rounds of grapeshot before the hussars
got back to their horses Two were misdirected and the shot went too
high but the last round fell in the midst of a group of hussars and
knocked three of them over

Rostv absorbed by his relations with Bogdanich had paused on the
bridge not knowing what to do There was no one to hew down as he had
always imagined battles to himself nor could he help to fire the
bridge because he had not brought any burning straw with him like the
other soldiers He stood looking about him when suddenly he heard a
rattle on the bridge as if nuts were being spilt and the hussar nearest
to him fell against the rails with a groan Rostv ran up to him with
the others Again someone shouted Stretchers Four men seized the
hussar and began lifting him

Oooh For Christs sake let me alone cried the wounded man but still
he was lifted and laid on the stretcher

Nicholas Rostv turned away and as if searching for something gazed
into the distance at the waters of the Danube at the sky and at the
sun How beautiful the sky looked how blue how calm and how deep How
bright and glorious was the setting sun With what soft glitter the
waters of the distant Danube shone And fairer still were the faraway
blue mountains beyond the river the nunnery the mysterious gorges and
the pine forests veiled in the mist of their summits There was peace
and happiness I should wish for nothing else nothing if only I
were there thought Rostv In myself alone and in that sunshine there
is so much happiness but here groans suffering fear and this
uncertainty and hurry Therethey are shouting again and again are
all running back somewhere and I shall run with them and it death is
here above me and around Another instant and I shall never again see
the sun this water that gorge

At that instant the sun began to hide behind the clouds and other
stretchers came into view before Rostv And the fear of death and of
the stretchers and love of the sun and of life all merged into one
feeling of sickening agitation

O Lord God Thou who art in that heaven save forgive and protect
me Rostv whispered

The hussars ran back to the men who held their horses their voices
sounded louder and calmer the stretchers disappeared from sight

Well fwiend So youve smelt powdah shouted Vaska Denisov just above
his ear

Its all over but I am a cowardyes a coward thought Rostv and
sighing deeply he took Rook his horse which stood resting one foot
from the orderly and began to mount

Was that grapeshot he asked Denisov

Yes and no mistake cried Denisov You worked like wegular bwicks and
its nasty work An attacks pleasant work Hacking away at the dogs
But this sort of thing is the very devil with them shooting at you like
a target

And Denisov rode up to a group that had stopped near Rostv composed of
the colonel Nesvtski Zherkov and the officer from the suite

Well it seems that no one has noticed thought Rostv And this was
true No one had taken any notice for everyone knew the sensation which
the cadet under fire for the first time had experienced

Heres something for you to report said Zherkov See if I dont get
promoted to a sublieutenancy

Inform the prince that I the bridge fired said the colonel
triumphantly and gaily

And if he asks about the losses

A trifle said the colonel in his bass voice two hussars wounded
and one knocked out he added unable to restrain a happy smile and
pronouncing the phrase knocked out with ringing distinctness





CHAPTER IX

Pursued by the French army of a hundred thousand men under the command
of Bonaparte encountering a population that was unfriendly to it
losing confidence in its allies suffering from shortness of supplies
and compelled to act under conditions of war unlike anything that had
been foreseen the Russian army of thirtyfive thousand men commanded by
Kutzov was hurriedly retreating along the Danube stopping where
overtaken by the enemy and fighting rearguard actions only as far as
necessary to enable it to retreat without losing its heavy equipment
There had been actions at Lambach Amstetten and Melk but despite the
courage and enduranceacknowledged even by the enemywith which the
Russians fought the only consequence of these actions was a yet more
rapid retreat Austrian troops that had escaped capture at Ulm and had
joined Kutzov at Braunau now separated from the Russian army and
Kutzov was left with only his own weak and exhausted forces The
defense of Vienna was no longer to be thought of Instead of an
offensive the plan of which carefully prepared in accord with the
modern science of strategics had been handed to Kutzov when he was in
Vienna by the Austrian Hofkriegsrath the sole and almost unattainable
aim remaining for him was to effect a junction with the forces that were
advancing from Russia without losing his army as Mack had done at Ulm

On the twentyeighth of October Kutzov with his army crossed to the
left bank of the Danube and took up a position for the first time with
the river between himself and the main body of the French On the
thirtieth he attacked Mortiers division which was on the left bank
and broke it up In this action for the first time trophies were taken
banners cannon and two enemy generals For the first time after a
fortnights retreat the Russian troops had halted and after a fight had
not only held the field but had repulsed the French Though the troops
were illclad exhausted and had lost a third of their number in
killed wounded sick and stragglers though a number of sick and
wounded had been abandoned on the other side of the Danube with a letter
in which Kutzov entrusted them to the humanity of the enemy and though
the big hospitals and the houses in Krems converted into military
hospitals could no longer accommodate all the sick and wounded yet the
stand made at Krems and the victory over Mortier raised the spirits of
the army considerably Throughout the whole army and at headquarters
most joyful though erroneous rumors were rife of the imaginary approach
of columns from Russia of some victory gained by the Austrians and of
the retreat of the frightened Bonaparte

Prince Andrew during the battle had been in attendance on the Austrian
General Schmidt who was killed in the action His horse had been
wounded under him and his own arm slightly grazed by a bullet As a mark
of the commanderinchiefs special favor he was sent with the news of
this victory to the Austrian court now no longer at Vienna which was
threatened by the French but at Brunn Despite his apparently delicate
build Prince Andrew could endure physical fatigue far better than many
very muscular men and on the night of the battle having arrived at
Krems excited but not weary with dispatches from Dokhturov to Kutzov
he was sent immediately with a special dispatch to Brunn To be so sent
meant not only a reward but an important step toward promotion

The night was dark but starry the road showed black in the snow that
had fallen the previous daythe day of the battle Reviewing his
impressions of the recent battle picturing pleasantly to himself the
impression his news of a victory would create or recalling the sendoff
given him by the commanderinchief and his fellow officers Prince
Andrew was galloping along in a post chaise enjoying the feelings of a
man who has at length begun to attain a longdesired happiness As soon
as he closed his eyes his ears seemed filled with the rattle of the
wheels and the sensation of victory Then he began to imagine that the
Russians were running away and that he himself was killed but he
quickly roused himself with a feeling of joy as if learning afresh that
this was not so but that on the contrary the French had run away He
again recalled all the details of the victory and his own calm courage
during the battle and feeling reassured he dozed off The dark
starry night was followed by a bright cheerful morning The snow was
thawing in the sunshine the horses galloped quickly and on both sides
of the road were forests of different kinds fields and villages

At one of the post stations he overtook a convoy of Russian wounded The
Russian officer in charge of the transport lolled back in the front
cart shouting and scolding a soldier with coarse abuse In each of the
long German carts six or more pale dirty bandaged men were being
jolted over the stony road Some of them were talking he heard Russian
words others were eating bread the more severely wounded looked
silently with the languid interest of sick children at the envoy
hurrying past them

Prince Andrew told his driver to stop and asked a soldier in what
action they had been wounded Day before yesterday on the Danube
answered the soldier Prince Andrew took out his purse and gave the
soldier three gold pieces

Thats for them all he said to the officer who came up

Get well soon lads he continued turning to the soldiers Theres
plenty to do still

What news sir asked the officer evidently anxious to start a
conversation

Good news Go on he shouted to the driver and they galloped on

It was already quite dark when Prince Andrew rattled over the paved
streets of Brunn and found himself surrounded by high buildings the
lights of shops houses and street lamps fine carriages and all that
atmosphere of a large and active town which is always so attractive to a
soldier after camp life Despite his rapid journey and sleepless night
Prince Andrew when he drove up to the palace felt even more vigorous and
alert than he had done the day before Only his eyes gleamed feverishly
and his thoughts followed one another with extraordinary clearness and
rapidity He again vividly recalled the details of the battle no longer
dim but definite and in the concise form in which he imagined himself
stating them to the Emperor Francis He vividly imagined the casual
questions that might be put to him and the answers he would give He
expected to be at once presented to the Emperor At the chief entrance
to the palace however an official came running out to meet him and
learning that he was a special messenger led him to another entrance

To the right from the corridor Euer Hochgeboren There you will find
the adjutant on duty said the official He will conduct you to the
Minister of War

The adjutant on duty meeting Prince Andrew asked him to wait and went
in to the Minister of War Five minutes later he returned and bowing
with particular courtesy ushered Prince Andrew before him along a
corridor to the cabinet where the Minister of War was at work The
adjutant by his elaborate courtesy appeared to wish to ward off any
attempt at familiarity on the part of the Russian messenger

Prince Andrews joyous feeling was considerably weakened as he
approached the door of the ministers room He felt offended and
without his noticing it the feeling of offense immediately turned into
one of disdain which was quite uncalled for His fertile mind instantly
suggested to him a point of view which gave him a right to despise the
adjutant and the minister Away from the smell of powder they probably
think it easy to gain victories he thought His eyes narrowed
disdainfully he entered the room of the Minister of War with peculiarly
deliberate steps This feeling of disdain was heightened when he saw the
minister seated at a large table reading some papers and making pencil
notes on them and for the first two or three minutes taking no notice
of his arrival A wax candle stood at each side of the ministers bent
bald head with its gray temples He went on reading to the end without
raising his eyes at the opening of the door and the sound of footsteps

Take this and deliver it said he to his adjutant handing him the
papers and still taking no notice of the special messenger

Prince Andrew felt that either the actions of Kutzovs army interested
the Minister of War less than any of the other matters he was concerned
with or he wanted to give the Russian special messenger that
impression But that is a matter of perfect indifference to me he
thought The minister drew the remaining papers together arranged them
evenly and then raised his head He had an intellectual and distinctive
head but the instant he turned to Prince Andrew the firm intelligent
expression on his face changed in a way evidently deliberate and
habitual to him His face took on the stupid artificial smile which
does not even attempt to hide its artificiality of a man who is
continually receiving many petitioners one after another

From General Field Marshal Kutzov he asked I hope it is good news
There has been an encounter with Mortier A victory It was high time

He took the dispatch which was addressed to him and began to read it
with a mournful expression

Oh my God My God Schmidt he exclaimed in German What a calamity
What a calamity

Having glanced through the dispatch he laid it on the table and looked
at Prince Andrew evidently considering something

Ah what a calamity You say the affair was decisive But Mortier is not
captured Again he pondered I am very glad you have brought good
news though Schmidts death is a heavy price to pay for the victory
His Majesty will no doubt wish to see you but not today I thank you
You must have a rest Be at the levee tomorrow after the parade
However I will let you know

The stupid smile which had left his face while he was speaking
reappeared

Au revoir Thank you very much His Majesty will probably desire to see
you he added bowing his head

When Prince Andrew left the palace he felt that all the interest and
happiness the victory had afforded him had been now left in the
indifferent hands of the Minister of War and the polite adjutant The
whole tenor of his thoughts instantaneously changed the battle seemed
the memory of a remote event long past





CHAPTER X

Prince Andrew stayed at Brunn with Bilibin a Russian acquaintance of
his in the diplomatic service

Ah my dear prince I could not have a more welcome visitor said
Bilibin as he came out to meet Prince Andrew Franz put the princes
things in my bedroom said he to the servant who was ushering Bolknski
in So youre a messenger of victory eh Splendid And I am sitting
here ill as you see

After washing and dressing Prince Andrew came into the diplomats
luxurious study and sat down to the dinner prepared for him Bilibin
settled down comfortably beside the fire

After his journey and the campaign during which he had been deprived of
all the comforts of cleanliness and all the refinements of life Prince
Andrew felt a pleasant sense of repose among luxurious surroundings such
as he had been accustomed to from childhood Besides it was pleasant
after his reception by the Austrians to speak if not in Russian for
they were speaking French at least with a Russian who would he
supposed share the general Russian antipathy to the Austrians which was
then particularly strong

Bilibin was a man of thirtyfive a bachelor and of the same circle as
Prince Andrew They had known each other previously in Petersburg but
had become more intimate when Prince Andrew was in Vienna with Kutzov
Just as Prince Andrew was a young man who gave promise of rising high in
the military profession so to an even greater extent Bilibin gave
promise of rising in his diplomatic career He still a young man but no
longer a young diplomat as he had entered the service at the age of
sixteen had been in Paris and Copenhagen and now held a rather
important post in Vienna Both the foreign minister and our ambassador
in Vienna knew him and valued him He was not one of those many
diplomats who are esteemed because they have certain negative qualities
avoid doing certain things and speak French He was one of those who
liking work knew how to do it and despite his indolence would
sometimes spend a whole night at his writing table He worked well
whatever the import of his work It was not the question What for but
the question How that interested him What the diplomatic matter
might be he did not care but it gave him great pleasure to prepare a
circular memorandum or report skillfully pointedly and elegantly
Bilibins services were valued not only for what he wrote but also for
his skill in dealing and conversing with those in the highest spheres

Bilibin liked conversation as he liked work only when it could be made
elegantly witty In society he always awaited an opportunity to say
something striking and took part in a conversation only when that was
possible His conversation was always sprinkled with wittily original
finished phrases of general interest These sayings were prepared in the
inner laboratory of his mind in a portable form as if intentionally so
that insignificant society people might carry them from drawing room to
drawing room And in fact Bilibins witticisms were hawked about in
the Viennese drawing rooms and often had an influence on matters
considered important

His thin worn sallow face was covered with deep wrinkles which always
looked as clean and well washed as the tips of ones fingers after a
Russian bath The movement of these wrinkles formed the principal play
of expression on his face Now his forehead would pucker into deep folds
and his eyebrows were lifted then his eyebrows would descend and deep
wrinkles would crease his cheeks His small deepset eyes always
twinkled and looked out straight

Well now tell me about your exploits said he

Bolknski very modestly without once mentioning himself described the
engagement and his reception by the Minister of War

They received me and my news as one receives a dog in a game of
skittles said he in conclusion

Bilibin smiled and the wrinkles on his face disappeared

Cependant mon cher he remarked examining his nails from a distance
and puckering the skin above his left eye malgre la haute estime que
je professe pour the Orthodox Russian army javoue que votre victoire
nest pas des plus victorieuses

 But my dear fellow with all my respect for the Orthodox Russian
army I must say that your victory was not particularly victorious

He went on talking in this way in French uttering only those words in
Russian on which he wished to put a contemptuous emphasis

Come now You with all your forces fall on the unfortunate Mortier and
his one division and even then Mortier slips through your fingers
Wheres the victory

But seriously said Prince Andrew we can at any rate say without
boasting that it was a little better than at Ulm

Why didnt you capture one just one marshal for us

Because not everything happens as one expects or with the smoothness of
a parade We had expected as I told you to get at their rear by seven
in the morning but had not reached it by five in the afternoon

And why didnt you do it at seven in the morning You ought to have
been there at seven in the morning returned Bilibin with a smile You
ought to have been there at seven in the morning

Why did you not succeed in impressing on Bonaparte by diplomatic
methods that he had better leave Genoa alone retorted Prince Andrew in
the same tone

I know interrupted Bilibin youre thinking its very easy to take
marshals sitting on a sofa by the fire That is true but still why
didnt you capture him So dont be surprised if not only the Minister
of War but also his Most August Majesty the Emperor and King Francis is
not much delighted by your victory Even I a poor secretary of the
Russian Embassy do not feel any need in token of my joy to give my
Franz a thaler or let him go with his Liebchen to the Prater True
we have no Prater here

He looked straight at Prince Andrew and suddenly unwrinkled his
forehead

It is now my turn to ask you why mon cher said Bolknski I
confess I do not understand perhaps there are diplomatic subtleties
here beyond my feeble intelligence but I cant make it out Mack loses
a whole army the Archduke Ferdinand and the Archduke Karl give no signs
of life and make blunder after blunder Kutzov alone at last gains a
real victory destroying the spell of the invincibility of the French
and the Minister of War does not even care to hear the details

Thats just it my dear fellow You see its hurrah for the Tsar for
Russia for the Orthodox Greek faith All that is beautiful but what do
we I mean the Austrian court care for your victories Bring us nice
news of a victory by the Archduke Karl or Ferdinand one archdukes as
good as another as you know and even if it is only over a fire brigade
of Bonapartes that will be another story and well fire off some
cannon But this sort of thing seems done on purpose to vex us The
Archduke Karl does nothing the Archduke Ferdinand disgraces himself
You abandon Vienna give up its defenseas much as to say Heaven is
with us but heaven help you and your capital The one general whom we
all loved Schmidt you expose to a bullet and then you congratulate us
on the victory Admit that more irritating news than yours could not
have been conceived Its as if it had been done on purpose on purpose
Besides suppose you did gain a brilliant victory if even the Archduke
Karl gained a victory what effect would that have on the general course
of events Its too late now when Vienna is occupied by the French
army

What Occupied Vienna occupied

Not only occupied but Bonaparte is at Schonbrunn and the count our
dear Count Vrbna goes to him for orders

After the fatigues and impressions of the journey his reception and
especially after having dined Bolknski felt that he could not take in
the full significance of the words he heard

Count Lichtenfels was here this morning Bilibin continued and
showed me a letter in which the parade of the French in Vienna was fully
described Prince Murat et tout le tremblement You see that your
victory is not a matter for great rejoicing and that you cant be
received as a savior

Really I dont care about that I dont care at all said Prince
Andrew beginning to understand that his news of the battle before Krems
was really of small importance in view of such events as the fall of
Austrias capital How is it Vienna was taken What of the bridge and
its celebrated bridgehead and Prince Auersperg We heard reports that
Prince Auersperg was defending Vienna he said

Prince Auersperg is on this on our side of the river and is defending
usdoing it very badly I think but still he is defending us But
Vienna is on the other side No the bridge has not yet been taken and I
hope it will not be for it is mined and orders have been given to blow
it up Otherwise we should long ago have been in the mountains of
Bohemia and you and your army would have spent a bad quarter of an hour
between two fires

But still this does not mean that the campaign is over said Prince
Andrew

Well I think it is The bigwigs here think so too but they darent
say so It will be as I said at the beginning of the campaign it wont
be your skirmishing at Durrenstein or gunpowder at all that will
decide the matter but those who devised it said Bilibin quoting one
of his own mots releasing the wrinkles on his forehead and pausing
The only question is what will come of the meeting between the Emperor
Alexander and the King of Prussia in Berlin If Prussia joins the
Allies Austrias hand will be forced and there will be war If not it
is merely a question of settling where the preliminaries of the new
Campo Formio are to be drawn up

What an extraordinary genius Prince Andrew suddenly exclaimed
clenching his small hand and striking the table with it and what luck
the man has

Buonaparte said Bilibin inquiringly puckering up his forehead to
indicate that he was about to say something witty Buonaparte he
repeated accentuating the u I think however now that he lays down
laws for Austria at Schonbrunn il faut lui faire grace de lu I
shall certainly adopt an innovation and call him simply Bonaparte

 We must let him off the u

But joking apart said Prince Andrew do you really think the
campaign is over

This is what I think Austria has been made a fool of and she is not
used to it She will retaliate And she has been fooled in the first
place because her provinces have been pillagedthey say the Holy Russian
army loots terriblyher army is destroyed her capital taken and all
this for the beaux yeux of His Sardinian Majesty And thereforethis
is between ourselvesI instinctively feel that we are being deceived my
instinct tells me of negotiations with France and projects for peace a
secret peace concluded separately

 Fine eyes

Impossible cried Prince Andrew That would be too base

If we live we shall see replied Bilibin his face again becoming
smooth as a sign that the conversation was at an end

When Prince Andrew reached the room prepared for him and lay down in a
clean shirt on the feather bed with its warmed and fragrant pillows he
felt that the battle of which he had brought tidings was far far away
from him The alliance with Prussia Austrias treachery Bonapartes
new triumph tomorrows levee and parade and the audience with the
Emperor Francis occupied his thoughts

He closed his eyes and immediately a sound of cannonading of musketry
and the rattling of carriage wheels seemed to fill his ears and now
again drawn out in a thin line the musketeers were descending the hill
the French were firing and he felt his heart palpitating as he rode
forward beside Schmidt with the bullets merrily whistling all around
and he experienced tenfold the joy of living as he had not done since
childhood

He woke up

Yes that all happened he said and smiling happily to himself like
a child he fell into a deep youthful slumber





CHAPTER XI

Next day he woke late Recalling his recent impressions the first
thought that came into his mind was that today he had to be presented to
the Emperor Francis he remembered the Minister of War the polite
Austrian adjutant Bilibin and last nights conversation Having
dressed for his attendance at court in full parade uniform which he had
not worn for a long time he went into Bilibins study fresh animated
and handsome with his hand bandaged In the study were four gentlemen
of the diplomatic corps With Prince Hippolyte Kurgin who was a
secretary to the embassy Bolknski was already acquainted Bilibin
introduced him to the others

The gentlemen assembled at Bilibins were young wealthy gay society
men who here as in Vienna formed a special set which Bilibin their
leader called les notres This set consisting almost exclusively of
diplomats evidently had its own interests which had nothing to do with
war or politics but related to high society to certain women and to
the official side of the service These gentlemen received Prince Andrew
as one of themselves an honor they did not extend to many From
politeness and to start conversation they asked him a few questions
about the army and the battle and then the talk went off into merry
jests and gossip

 Ours

But the best of it was said one telling of the misfortune of a
fellow diplomat that the Chancellor told him flatly that his
appointment to London was a promotion and that he was so to regard it
Can you fancy the figure he cut

But the worst of it gentlemenI am giving Kurgin away to youis that
that man suffers and this Don Juan wicked fellow is taking advantage
of it

Prince Hippolyte was lolling in a lounge chair with his legs over its
arm He began to laugh

Tell me about that he said

Oh you Don Juan You serpent cried several voices

You Bolknski dont know said Bilibin turning to Prince Andrew
that all the atrocities of the French army I nearly said of the
Russian army are nothing compared to what this man has been doing among
the women

La femme est la compagne de lhomme announced Prince Hippolyte and
began looking through a lorgnette at his elevated legs

 Woman is mans companion

Bilibin and the rest of ours burst out laughing in Hippolytes face
and Prince Andrew saw that Hippolyte of whomhe had to admithe had
almost been jealous on his wifes account was the butt of this set

Oh I must give you a treat Bilibin whispered to Bolknski Kurgin
is exquisite when he discusses politicsyou should see his gravity

He sat down beside Hippolyte and wrinkling his forehead began talking to
him about politics Prince Andrew and the others gathered round these
two

The Berlin cabinet cannot express a feeling of alliance began
Hippolyte gazing round with importance at the others without
expressing as in its last note you understand Besides unless
His Majesty the Emperor derogates from the principle of our alliance

Wait I have not finished he said to Prince Andrew seizing him by
the arm I believe that intervention will be stronger than
nonintervention And he paused Finally one cannot impute the
nonreceipt of our dispatch of November 18 That is how it will end And
he released Bolknskis arm to indicate that he had now quite finished

Demosthenes I know thee by the pebble thou secretest in thy golden
mouth said Bilibin and the mop of hair on his head moved with
satisfaction

Everybody laughed and Hippolyte louder than anyone He was evidently
distressed and breathed painfully but could not restrain the wild
laughter that convulsed his usually impassive features

Well now gentlemen said Bilibin Bolknski is my guest in this
house and in Brunn itself I want to entertain him as far as I can with
all the pleasures of life here If we were in Vienna it would be easy
but here in this wretched Moravian hole it is more difficult and I
beg you all to help me Brunns attractions must be shown him You can
undertake the theater I society and you Hippolyte of course the
women

We must let him see Amelie shes exquisite said one of ours
kissing his finger tips

In general we must turn this bloodthirsty soldier to more humane
interests said Bilibin

I shall scarcely be able to avail myself of your hospitality
gentlemen it is already time for me to go replied Prince Andrew
looking at his watch

Where to

To the Emperor

Oh Oh Oh Well au revoir Bolknski Au revoir Prince Come back
early to dinner cried several voices Well take you in hand

When speaking to the Emperor try as far as you can to praise the way
that provisions are supplied and the routes indicated said Bilibin
accompanying him to the hall

I should like to speak well of them but as far as I know the facts I
cant replied Bolknski smiling

Well talk as much as you can anyway He has a passion for giving
audiences but he does not like talking himself and cant do it as you
will see





CHAPTER XII

At the levee Prince Andrew stood among the Austrian officers as he had
been told to and the Emperor Francis merely looked fixedly into his
face and just nodded to him with his long head But after it was over
the adjutant he had seen the previous day ceremoniously informed
Bolknski that the Emperor desired to give him an audience The Emperor
Francis received him standing in the middle of the room Before the
conversation began Prince Andrew was struck by the fact that the Emperor
seemed confused and blushed as if not knowing what to say

Tell me when did the battle begin he asked hurriedly

Prince Andrew replied Then followed other questions just as simple
Was Kutzov well When had he left Krems and so on The Emperor spoke
as if his sole aim were to put a given number of questionsthe answers
to these questions as was only too evident did not interest him

At what oclock did the battle begin asked the Emperor

I cannot inform Your Majesty at what oclock the battle began at the
front but at Durrenstein where I was our attack began after five in
the afternoon replied Bolknski growing more animated and expecting
that he would have a chance to give a reliable account which he had
ready in his mind of all he knew and had seen But the Emperor smiled
and interrupted him

How many miles

From where to where Your Majesty

From Durrenstein to Krems

Three and a half miles Your Majesty

The French have abandoned the left bank

According to the scouts the last of them crossed on rafts during the
night

Is there sufficient forage in Krems

Forage has not been supplied to the extent

The Emperor interrupted him

At what oclock was General Schmidt killed

At seven oclock I believe

At seven oclock Its very sad very sad

The Emperor thanked Prince Andrew and bowed Prince Andrew withdrew and
was immediately surrounded by courtiers on all sides Everywhere he saw
friendly looks and heard friendly words Yesterdays adjutant reproached
him for not having stayed at the palace and offered him his own house
The Minister of War came up and congratulated him on the Maria Theresa
Order of the third grade which the Emperor was conferring on him The
Empress chamberlain invited him to see Her Majesty The archduchess
also wished to see him He did not know whom to answer and for a few
seconds collected his thoughts Then the Russian ambassador took him by
the shoulder led him to the window and began to talk to him

Contrary to Bilibins forecast the news he had brought was joyfully
received A thanksgiving service was arranged Kutzov was awarded the
Grand Cross of Maria Theresa and the whole army received rewards
Bolknski was invited everywhere and had to spend the whole morning
calling on the principal Austrian dignitaries Between four and five in
the afternoon having made all his calls he was returning to Bilibins
house thinking out a letter to his father about the battle and his visit
to Brunn At the door he found a vehicle half full of luggage Franz
Bilibins man was dragging a portmanteau with some difficulty out of
the front door

Before returning to Bilibins Prince Andrew had gone to a bookshop to
provide himself with some books for the campaign and had spent some
time in the shop

What is it he asked

Oh your excellency said Franz with difficulty rolling the
portmanteau into the vehicle we are to move on still farther The
scoundrel is again at our heels

Eh What asked Prince Andrew

Bilibin came out to meet him His usually calm face showed excitement

There now Confess that this is delightful said he This affair of
the Thabor Bridge at Vienna They have crossed without striking a
blow

Prince Andrew could not understand

But where do you come from not to know what every coachman in the town
knows

I come from the archduchess I heard nothing there

And you didnt see that everybody is packing up

I did not What is it all about inquired Prince Andrew impatiently

Whats it all about Why the French have crossed the bridge that
Auersperg was defending and the bridge was not blown up so Murat is
now rushing along the road to Brunn and will be here in a day or two

What Here But why did they not blow up the bridge if it was mined

That is what I ask you No one not even Bonaparte knows why

Bolknski shrugged his shoulders

But if the bridge is crossed it means that the army too is lost It
will be cut off said he

Thats just it answered Bilibin Listen The French entered Vienna
as I told you Very well Next day which was yesterday those
gentlemen messieurs les marechaux Murat Lannes and Belliard mount
and ride to the bridge Observe that all three are Gascons
Gentlemen says one of them you know the Thabor Bridge is mined and
doubly mined and that there are menacing fortifications at its head and
an army of fifteen thousand men has been ordered to blow up the bridge
and not let us cross But it will please our sovereign the Emperor
Napoleon if we take this bridge so let us three go and take it Yes
lets say the others And off they go and take the bridge cross it
and now with their whole army are on this side of the Danube marching
on us you and your lines of communication

 The marshalls

Stop jesting said Prince Andrew sadly and seriously This news
grieved him and yet he was pleased

As soon as he learned that the Russian army was in such a hopeless
situation it occurred to him that it was he who was destined to lead it
out of this position that here was the Toulon that would lift him from
the ranks of obscure officers and offer him the first step to fame
Listening to Bilibin he was already imagining how on reaching the army
he would give an opinion at the war council which would be the only one
that could save the army and how he alone would be entrusted with the
executing of the plan

Stop this jesting he said

I am not jesting Bilibin went on Nothing is truer or sadder These
gentlemen ride onto the bridge alone and wave white handkerchiefs they
assure the officer on duty that they the marshals are on their way to
negotiate with Prince Auersperg He lets them enter the ttedepont
They spin him a thousand gasconades saying that the war is over that
the Emperor Francis is arranging a meeting with Bonaparte that they
desire to see Prince Auersperg and so on The officer sends for
Auersperg these gentlemen embrace the officers crack jokes sit on the
cannon and meanwhile a French battalion gets to the bridge unobserved
flings the bags of incendiary material into the water and approaches
the ttedepont At length appears the lieutenant general our dear
Prince Auersperg von Mautern himself Dearest foe Flower of the
Austrian army hero of the Turkish wars Hostilities are ended we can
shake one anothers hand The Emperor Napoleon burns with impatience
to make Prince Auerspergs acquaintance In a word those gentlemen
Gascons indeed so bewildered him with fine words and he is so
flattered by his rapidly established intimacy with the French marshals
and so dazzled by the sight of Murats mantle and ostrich plumes quil
ny voit que du feu et oublie celui quil devait faire faire sur
lennemi 2 In spite of the animation of his speech Bilibin did not
forget to pause after this mot to give time for its due appreciation
The French battalion rushes to the bridgehead spikes the guns and the
bridge is taken But what is best of all he went on his excitement
subsiding under the delightful interest of his own story is that the
sergeant in charge of the cannon which was to give the signal to fire
the mines and blow up the bridge this sergeant seeing that the French
troops were running onto the bridge was about to fire but Lannes
stayed his hand The sergeant who was evidently wiser than his general
goes up to Auersperg and says Prince you are being deceived here are
the French Murat seeing that all is lost if the sergeant is allowed
to speak turns to Auersperg with feigned astonishment he is a true
Gascon and says I dont recognize the worldfamous Austrian
discipline if you allow a subordinate to address you like that It was
a stroke of genius Prince Auersperg feels his dignity at stake and
orders the sergeant to be arrested Come you must own that this affair
of the Thabor Bridge is delightful It is not exactly stupidity nor
rascality

 Bridgehead

 2 That their fire gets into his eyes and he forgets that he ought to
be firing at the enemy

It may be treachery said Prince Andrew vividly imagining the gray
overcoats wounds the smoke of gunpowder the sounds of firing and the
glory that awaited him

Not that either That puts the court in too bad a light replied
Bilibin Its not treachery nor rascality nor stupidity it is just as
at Ulm it ishe seemed to be trying to find the right expression
Cest cest du Mack Nous sommes mackes It is it is a bit of
Mack We are Macked he concluded feeling that he had produced a good
epigram a fresh one that would be repeated His hitherto puckered brow
became smooth as a sign of pleasure and with a slight smile he began to
examine his nails

Where are you off to he said suddenly to Prince Andrew who had risen
and was going toward his room

I am going away

Where to

To the army

But you meant to stay another two days

But now I am off at once

And Prince Andrew after giving directions about his departure went to
his room

Do you know mon cher said Bilibin following him I have been
thinking about you Why are you going

And in proof of the conclusiveness of his opinion all the wrinkles
vanished from his face

Prince Andrew looked inquiringly at him and gave no reply

Why are you going I know you think it your duty to gallop back to the
army now that it is in danger I understand that Mon cher it is
heroism

Not at all said Prince Andrew

But as you are a philosopher be a consistent one look at the other
side of the question and you will see that your duty on the contrary
is to take care of yourself Leave it to those who are no longer fit for
anything else You have not been ordered to return and have not been
dismissed from here therefore you can stay and go with us wherever our
ill luck takes us They say we are going to Olmutz and Olmutz is a very
decent town You and I will travel comfortably in my calche

Do stop joking Bilibin cried Bolknski

I am speaking sincerely as a friend Consider Where and why are you
going when you might remain here You are faced by one of two things
and the skin over his left temple puckered either you will not reach
your regiment before peace is concluded or you will share defeat and
disgrace with Kutzovs whole army

And Bilibin unwrinkled his temple feeling that the dilemma was
insoluble

I cannot argue about it replied Prince Andrew coldly but he thought
I am going to save the army

My dear fellow you are a hero said Bilibin





CHAPTER XIII

That same night having taken leave of the Minister of War Bolknski
set off to rejoin the army not knowing where he would find it and
fearing to be captured by the French on the way to Krems

In Brunn everybody attached to the court was packing up and the heavy
baggage was already being dispatched to Olmutz Near Hetzelsdorf Prince
Andrew struck the high road along which the Russian army was moving with
great haste and in the greatest disorder The road was so obstructed
with carts that it was impossible to get by in a carriage Prince Andrew
took a horse and a Cossack from a Cossack commander and hungry and
weary making his way past the baggage wagons rode in search of the
commanderinchief and of his own luggage Very sinister reports of the
position of the army reached him as he went along and the appearance of
the troops in their disorderly flight confirmed these rumors

Cette armee russe que lor de lAngleterre a transportee des extremites
de lunivers nous allons lui faire eprouver le meme sortle sort de
larmee dUlm He remembered these words in Bonapartes address to
his army at the beginning of the campaign and they awoke in him
astonishment at the genius of his hero a feeling of wounded pride and
a hope of glory And should there be nothing left but to die he
thought Well if need be I shall do it no worse than others

 That Russian army which has been brought from the ends of the earth
by English gold we shall cause to share the same fatethe fate of the
army at Ulm

He looked with disdain at the endless confused mass of detachments
carts guns artillery and again baggage wagons and vehicles of all
kinds overtaking one another and blocking the muddy road three and
sometimes four abreast From all sides behind and before as far as ear
could reach there were the rattle of wheels the creaking of carts and
gun carriages the tramp of horses the crack of whips shouts the
urging of horses and the swearing of soldiers orderlies and officers
All along the sides of the road fallen horses were to be seen some
flayed some not and brokendown carts beside which solitary soldiers
sat waiting for something and again soldiers straggling from their
companies crowds of whom set off to the neighboring villages or
returned from them dragging sheep fowls hay and bulging sacks At
each ascent or descent of the road the crowds were yet denser and the
din of shouting more incessant Soldiers floundering kneedeep in mud
pushed the guns and wagons themselves Whips cracked hoofs slipped
traces broke and lungs were strained with shouting The officers
directing the march rode backward and forward between the carts Their
voices were but feebly heard amid the uproar and one saw by their faces
that they despaired of the possibility of checking this disorder

Here is our dear Orthodox Russian army thought Bolknski recalling
Bilibins words

Wishing to find out where the commanderinchief was he rode up to a
convoy Directly opposite to him came a strange onehorse vehicle
evidently rigged up by soldiers out of any available materials and
looking like something between a cart a cabriolet and a calche A
soldier was driving and a woman enveloped in shawls sat behind the
apron under the leather hood of the vehicle Prince Andrew rode up and
was just putting his question to a soldier when his attention was
diverted by the desperate shrieks of the woman in the vehicle An
officer in charge of transport was beating the soldier who was driving
the womans vehicle for trying to get ahead of others and the strokes
of his whip fell on the apron of the equipage The woman screamed
piercingly Seeing Prince Andrew she leaned out from behind the apron
and waving her thin arms from under the woolen shawl cried

Mr Aidedecamp Mr Aidedecamp For heavens sake Protect me
What will become of us I am the wife of the doctor of the Seventh
Chasseurs They wont let us pass we are left behind and have lost
our people

Ill flatten you into a pancake shouted the angry officer to the
soldier Turn back with your slut

Mr Aidedecamp Help me What does it all mean screamed the
doctors wife

Kindly let this cart pass Dont you see its a woman said Prince
Andrew riding up to the officer

The officer glanced at him and without replying turned again to the
soldier Ill teach you to push on Back

Let them pass I tell you repeated Prince Andrew compressing his
lips

And who are you cried the officer turning on him with tipsy rage
who are you Are you in command here Eh I am commander here not you
Go back or Ill flatten you into a pancake repeated he This
expression evidently pleased him

That was a nice snub for the little aidedecamp came a voice from
behind

Prince Andrew saw that the officer was in that state of senseless tipsy
rage when a man does not know what he is saying He saw that his
championship of the doctors wife in her queer trap might expose him to
what he dreaded more than anything in the worldto ridicule but his
instinct urged him on Before the officer finished his sentence Prince
Andrew his face distorted with fury rode up to him and raised his
riding whip

Kindly letthempass

The officer flourished his arm and hastily rode away

Its all the fault of these fellows on the staff that theres this
disorder he muttered Do as you like

Prince Andrew without lifting his eyes rode hastily away from the
doctors wife who was calling him her deliverer and recalling with a
sense of disgust the minutest details of this humiliating scene he
galloped on to the village where he was told that the commanderinchief
was

On reaching the village he dismounted and went to the nearest house
intending to rest if but for a moment eat something and try to sort
out the stinging and tormenting thoughts that confused his mind This
is a mob of scoundrels and not an army he was thinking as he went up
to the window of the first house when a familiar voice called him by
name

He turned round Nesvtskis handsome face looked out of the little
window Nesvtski moving his moist lips as he chewed something and
flourishing his arm called him to enter

Bolknski Bolknski Dont you hear Eh Come quick he shouted

Entering the house Prince Andrew saw Nesvtski and another adjutant
having something to eat They hastily turned round to him asking if he
had any news On their familiar faces he read agitation and alarm This
was particularly noticeable on Nesvtskis usually laughing countenance

Where is the commanderinchief asked Bolknski

Here in that house answered the adjutant

Well is it true that its peace and capitulation asked Nesvtski

I was going to ask you I know nothing except that it was all I could
do to get here

And we my dear boy Its terrible I was wrong to laugh at Mack were
getting it still worse said Nesvtski But sit down and have
something to eat

You wont be able to find either your baggage or anything else now
Prince And God only knows where your man Peter is said the other
adjutant

Where are headquarters

We are to spend the night in Znaim

Well I have got all I need into packs for two horses said Nesvtski
Theyve made up splendid packs for mefit to cross the Bohemian
mountains with Its a bad lookout old fellow But whats the matter
with you You must be ill to shiver like that he added noticing that
Prince Andrew winced as at an electric shock

Its nothing replied Prince Andrew

He had just remembered his recent encounter with the doctors wife and
the convoy officer

What is the commanderinchief doing here he asked

I cant make out at all said Nesvtski

Well all I can make out is that everything is abominable abominable
quite abominable said Prince Andrew and he went off to the house
where the commanderinchief was

Passing by Kutzovs carriage and the exhausted saddle horses of his
suite with their Cossacks who were talking loudly together Prince
Andrew entered the passage Kutzov himself he was told was in the
house with Prince Bagration and Weyrother Weyrother was the Austrian
general who had succeeded Schmidt In the passage little Kozlovski was
squatting on his heels in front of a clerk The clerk with cuffs turned
up was hastily writing at a tub turned bottom upwards Kozlovskis face
looked wornhe too had evidently not slept all night He glanced at
Prince Andrew and did not even nod to him

Second line have you written it he continued dictating to the
clerk The Kiev Grenadiers Podolian

One cant write so fast your honor said the clerk glancing angrily
and disrespectfully at Kozlovski

Through the door came the sounds of Kutzovs voice excited and
dissatisfied interrupted by another an unfamiliar voice From the
sound of these voices the inattentive way Kozlovski looked at him the
disrespectful manner of the exhausted clerk the fact that the clerk and
Kozlovski were squatting on the floor by a tub so near to the commander
in chief and from the noisy laughter of the Cossacks holding the horses
near the window Prince Andrew felt that something important and
disastrous was about to happen

He turned to Kozlovski with urgent questions

Immediately Prince said Kozlovski Dispositions for Bagration

What about capitulation

Nothing of the sort Orders are issued for a battle

Prince Andrew moved toward the door from whence voices were heard Just
as he was going to open it the sounds ceased the door opened and
Kutzov with his eagle nose and puffy face appeared in the doorway
Prince Andrew stood right in front of Kutzov but the expression of the
commander in chiefs one sound eye showed him to be so preoccupied with
thoughts and anxieties as to be oblivious of his presence He looked
straight at his adjutants face without recognizing him

Well have you finished said he to Kozlovski

One moment your excellency

Bagration a gaunt middleaged man of medium height with a firm
impassive face of Oriental type came out after the commanderinchief

I have the honor to present myself repeated Prince Andrew rather
loudly handing Kutzov an envelope

Ah from Vienna Very good Later later

Kutzov went out into the porch with Bagration

Well goodby Prince said he to Bagration My blessing and may
Christ be with you in your great endeavor

His face suddenly softened and tears came into his eyes With his left
hand he drew Bagration toward him and with his right on which he wore
a ring he made the sign of the cross over him with a gesture evidently
habitual offering his puffy cheek but Bagration kissed him on the neck
instead

Christ be with you Kutzov repeated and went toward his carriage
Get in with me said he to Bolknski

Your excellency I should like to be of use here Allow me to remain
with Prince Bagrations detachment

Get in said Kutzov and noticing that Bolknski still delayed he
added I need good officers myself need them myself

They got into the carriage and drove for a few minutes in silence

There is still much much before us he said as if with an old mans
penetration he understood all that was passing in Bolknskis mind If
a tenth part of his detachment returns I shall thank God he added as
if speaking to himself

Prince Andrew glanced at Kutzovs face only a foot distant from him and
involuntarily noticed the carefully washed seams of the scar near his
temple where an Ismail bullet had pierced his skull and the empty eye
socket Yes he has a right to speak so calmly of those mens death
thought Bolknski

That is why I beg to be sent to that detachment he said

Kutzov did not reply He seemed to have forgotten what he had been
saying and sat plunged in thought Five minutes later gently swaying
on the soft springs of the carriage he turned to Prince Andrew There
was not a trace of agitation on his face With delicate irony he
questioned Prince Andrew about the details of his interview with the
Emperor about the remarks he had heard at court concerning the Krems
affair and about some ladies they both knew





CHAPTER XIV

On November 1 Kutzov had received through a spy news that the army he
commanded was in an almost hopeless position The spy reported that the
French after crossing the bridge at Vienna were advancing in immense
force upon Kutzovs line of communication with the troops that were
arriving from Russia If Kutzov decided to remain at Krems Napoleons
army of one hundred and fifty thousand men would cut him off completely
and surround his exhausted army of forty thousand and he would find
himself in the position of Mack at Ulm If Kutzov decided to abandon
the road connecting him with the troops arriving from Russia he would
have to march with no road into unknown parts of the Bohemian mountains
defending himself against superior forces of the enemy and abandoning
all hope of a junction with Buxhowden If Kutzov decided to retreat
along the road from Krems to Olmutz to unite with the troops arriving
from Russia he risked being forestalled on that road by the French who
had crossed the Vienna bridge and encumbered by his baggage and
transport having to accept battle on the march against an enemy three
times as strong who would hem him in from two sides

Kutzov chose this latter course

The French the spy reported having crossed the Vienna bridge were
advancing by forced marches toward Znaim which lay sixtysix miles off
on the line of Kutzovs retreat If he reached Znaim before the French
there would be great hope of saving the army to let the French
forestall him at Znaim meant the exposure of his whole army to a
disgrace such as that of Ulm or to utter destruction But to forestall
the French with his whole army was impossible The road for the French
from Vienna to Znaim was shorter and better than the road for the
Russians from Krems to Znaim

The night he received the news Kutzov sent Bagrations vanguard four
thousand strong to the right across the hills from the KremsZnaim to
the ViennaZnaim road Bagration was to make this march without resting
and to halt facing Vienna with Znaim to his rear and if he succeeded in
forestalling the French he was to delay them as long as possible
Kutzov himself with all his transport took the road to Znaim

Marching thirty miles that stormy night across roadless hills with his
hungry illshod soldiers and losing a third of his men as stragglers
by the way Bagration came out on the ViennaZnaim road at Hollabrunn a
few hours ahead of the French who were approaching Hollabrunn from
Vienna Kutzov with his transport had still to march for some days
before he could reach Znaim Hence Bagration with his four thousand
hungry exhausted men would have to detain for days the whole enemy army
that came upon him at Hollabrunn which was clearly impossible But a
freak of fate made the impossible possible The success of the trick
that had placed the Vienna bridge in the hands of the French without a
fight led Murat to try to deceive Kutzov in a similar way Meeting
Bagrations weak detachment on the Znaim road he supposed it to be
Kutzovs whole army To be able to crush it absolutely he awaited the
arrival of the rest of the troops who were on their way from Vienna and
with this object offered a three days truce on condition that both
armies should remain in position without moving Murat declared that
negotiations for peace were already proceeding and that he therefore
offered this truce to avoid unnecessary bloodshed Count Nostitz the
Austrian general occupying the advanced posts believed Murats emissary
and retired leaving Bagrations division exposed Another emissary rode
to the Russian line to announce the peace negotiations and to offer the
Russian army the three days truce Bagration replied that he was not
authorized either to accept or refuse a truce and sent his adjutant to
Kutzov to report the offer he had received

A truce was Kutzovs sole chance of gaining time giving Bagrations
exhausted troops some rest and letting the transport and heavy convoys
whose movements were concealed from the French advance if but one
stage nearer Znaim The offer of a truce gave the only and a quite
unexpected chance of saving the army On receiving the news he
immediately dispatched Adjutant General Wintzingerode who was in
attendance on him to the enemy camp Wintzingerode was not merely to
agree to the truce but also to offer terms of capitulation and
meanwhile Kutzov sent his adjutants back to hasten to the utmost the
movements of the baggage trains of the entire army along the KremsZnaim
road Bagrations exhausted and hungry detachment which alone covered
this movement of the transport and of the whole army had to remain
stationary in face of an enemy eight times as strong as itself

Kutzovs expectations that the proposals of capitulation which were in
no way binding might give time for part of the transport to pass and
also that Murats mistake would very soon be discovered proved correct
As soon as Bonaparte who was at Schonbrunn sixteen miles from
Hollabrunn received Murats dispatch with the proposal of a truce and a
capitulation he detected a ruse and wrote the following letter to
Murat

Schonbrunn 25th Brumaire 1805

at eight oclock in the morning

To PRINCE MURAT

I cannot find words to express to you my displeasure You command only
my advance guard and have no right to arrange an armistice without my
order You are causing me to lose the fruits of a campaign Break the
armistice immediately and march on the enemy Inform him that the
general who signed that capitulation had no right to do so and that no
one but the Emperor of Russia has that right

If however the Emperor of Russia ratifies that convention I will
ratify it but it is only a trick March on destroy the Russian
army You are in a position to seize its baggage and artillery

The Russian Emperors aidedecamp is an impostor Officers are nothing
when they have no powers this one had none The Austrians let
themselves be tricked at the crossing of the Vienna bridge you are
letting yourself be tricked by an aidedecamp of the Emperor

NAPOLEON

Bonapartes adjutant rode full gallop with this menacing letter to
Murat Bonaparte himself not trusting to his generals moved with all
the Guards to the field of battle afraid of letting a ready victim
escape and Bagrations four thousand men merrily lighted campfires
dried and warmed themselves cooked their porridge for the first time
for three days and not one of them knew or imagined what was in store
for him





CHAPTER XV

Between three and four oclock in the afternoon Prince Andrew who had
persisted in his request to Kutzov arrived at Grunth and reported
himself to Bagration Bonapartes adjutant had not yet reached Murats
detachment and the battle had not yet begun In Bagrations detachment
no one knew anything of the general position of affairs They talked of
peace but did not believe in its possibility others talked of a battle
but also disbelieved in the nearness of an engagement Bagration
knowing Bolknski to be a favorite and trusted adjutant received him
with distinction and special marks of favor explaining to him that
there would probably be an engagement that day or the next and giving
him full liberty to remain with him during the battle or to join the
rearguard and have an eye on the order of retreat which is also very
important

However there will hardly be an engagement today said Bagration as
if to reassure Prince Andrew

If he is one of the ordinary little staff dandies sent to earn a medal
he can get his reward just as well in the rearguard but if he wishes to
stay with me let him hell be of use here if hes a brave officer
thought Bagration Prince Andrew without replying asked the princes
permission to ride round the position to see the disposition of the
forces so as to know his bearings should he be sent to execute an
order The officer on duty a handsome elegantly dressed man with a
diamond ring on his forefinger who was fond of speaking French though
he spoke it badly offered to conduct Prince Andrew

On all sides they saw rainsoaked officers with dejected faces who
seemed to be seeking something and soldiers dragging doors benches
and fencing from the village

There now Prince We cant stop those fellows said the staff officer
pointing to the soldiers The officers dont keep them in hand And
there he pointed to a sutlers tent they crowd in and sit This
morning I turned them all out and now look its full again I must go
there Prince and scare them a bit It wont take a moment

Yes lets go in and I will get myself a roll and some cheese said
Prince Andrew who had not yet had time to eat anything

Why didnt you mention it Prince I would have offered you something

They dismounted and entered the tent Several officers with flushed and
weary faces were sitting at the table eating and drinking

Now what does this mean gentlemen said the staff officer in the
reproachful tone of a man who has repeated the same thing more than
once You know it wont do to leave your posts like this The prince
gave orders that no one should leave his post Now you Captain and he
turned to a thin dirty little artillery officer who without his boots
he had given them to the canteen keeper to dry in only his stockings
rose when they entered smiling not altogether comfortably

Well arent you ashamed of yourself Captain Tushin he continued
One would think that as an artillery officer you would set a good
example yet here you are without your boots The alarm will be sounded
and youll be in a pretty position without your boots The staff
officer smiled Kindly return to your posts gentlemen all of you
all he added in a tone of command

Prince Andrew smiled involuntarily as he looked at the artillery officer
Tushin who silent and smiling shifting from one stockinged foot to the
other glanced inquiringly with his large intelligent kindly eyes from
Prince Andrew to the staff officer

The soldiers say it feels easier without boots said Captain Tushin
smiling shyly in his uncomfortable position evidently wishing to adopt
a jocular tone But before he had finished he felt that his jest was
unacceptable and had not come off He grew confused

Kindly return to your posts said the staff officer trying to preserve
his gravity

Prince Andrew glanced again at the artillery officers small figure
There was something peculiar about it quite unsoldierly rather comic
but extremely attractive

The staff officer and Prince Andrew mounted their horses and rode on

Having ridden beyond the village continually meeting and overtaking
soldiers and officers of various regiments they saw on their left some
entrenchments being thrown up the freshly dug clay of which showed up
red Several battalions of soldiers in their shirt sleeves despite the
cold wind swarmed in these earthworks like a host of white ants
spadefuls of red clay were continually being thrown up from behind the
bank by unseen hands Prince Andrew and the officer rode up looked at
the entrenchment and went on again Just behind it they came upon some
dozens of soldiers continually replaced by others who ran from the
entrenchment They had to hold their noses and put their horses to a
trot to escape from the poisoned atmosphere of these latrines

Voila lagrement des camps monsieur le Prince said the staff
officer

 This is a pleasure one gets in camp Prince

They rode up the opposite hill From there the French could already be
seen Prince Andrew stopped and began examining the position

Thats our battery said the staff officer indicating the highest
point Its in charge of the queer fellow we saw without his boots You
can see everything from there lets go there Prince

Thank you very much I will go on alone said Prince Andrew wishing
to rid himself of this staff officers company please dont trouble
yourself further

The staff officer remained behind and Prince Andrew rode on alone

The farther forward and nearer the enemy he went the more orderly and
cheerful were the troops The greatest disorder and depression had been
in the baggage train he had passed that morning on the Znaim road seven
miles away from the French At Grunth also some apprehension and alarm
could be felt but the nearer Prince Andrew came to the French lines the
more confident was the appearance of our troops The soldiers in their
greatcoats were ranged in lines the sergeants major and company
officers were counting the men poking the last man in each section in
the ribs and telling him to hold his hand up Soldiers scattered over
the whole place were dragging logs and brushwood and were building
shelters with merry chatter and laughter around the fires sat others
dressed and undressed drying their shirts and leg bands or mending
boots or overcoats and crowding round the boilers and porridge cookers
In one company dinner was ready and the soldiers were gazing eagerly at
the steaming boiler waiting till the sample which a quartermaster
sergeant was carrying in a wooden bowl to an officer who sat on a log
before his shelter had been tasted

Another company a lucky one for not all the companies had vodka
crowded round a pockmarked broadshouldered sergeant major who tilting
a keg filled one after another the canteen lids held out to him The
soldiers lifted the canteen lids to their lips with reverential faces
emptied them rolling the vodka in their mouths and walked away from
the sergeant major with brightened expressions licking their lips and
wiping them on the sleeves of their greatcoats All their faces were as
serene as if all this were happening at home awaiting peaceful
encampment and not within sight of the enemy before an action in which
at least half of them would be left on the field After passing a
chasseur regiment and in the lines of the Kiev grenadiersfine fellows
busy with similar peaceful affairsnear the shelter of the regimental
commander higher than and different from the others Prince Andrew came
out in front of a platoon of grenadiers before whom lay a naked man Two
soldiers held him while two others were flourishing their switches and
striking him regularly on his bare back The man shrieked unnaturally A
stout major was pacing up and down the line and regardless of the
screams kept repeating

Its a shame for a soldier to steal a soldier must be honest
honorable and brave but if he robs his fellows there is no honor in
him hes a scoundrel Go on Go on

So the swishing sound of the strokes and the desperate but unnatural
screams continued

Go on go on said the major

A young officer with a bewildered and pained expression on his face
stepped away from the man and looked round inquiringly at the adjutant
as he rode by

Prince Andrew having reached the front line rode along it Our front
line and that of the enemy were far apart on the right and left flanks
but in the center where the men with a flag of truce had passed that
morning the lines were so near together that the men could see one
anothers faces and speak to one another Besides the soldiers who
formed the picket line on either side there were many curious onlookers
who jesting and laughing stared at their strange foreign enemies

Since early morningdespite an injunction not to approach the picket
linethe officers had been unable to keep sightseers away The soldiers
forming the picket line like showmen exhibiting a curiosity no longer
looked at the French but paid attention to the sightseers and grew
weary waiting to be relieved Prince Andrew halted to have a look at the
French

Look Look there one soldier was saying to another pointing to a
Russian musketeer who had gone up to the picket line with an officer and
was rapidly and excitedly talking to a French grenadier Hark to him
jabbering Fine isnt it Its all the Frenchy can do to keep up with
him There now Sidorov

Wait a bit and listen Its fine answered Sidorov who was considered
an adept at French

The soldier to whom the laughers referred was Dlokhov Prince Andrew
recognized him and stopped to listen to what he was saying Dlokhov had
come from the left flank where their regiment was stationed with his
captain

Now then go on go on incited the officer bending forward and
trying not to lose a word of the speech which was incomprehensible to
him More please more Whats he saying

Dlokhov did not answer the captain he had been drawn into a hot
dispute with the French grenadier They were naturally talking about the
campaign The Frenchman confusing the Austrians with the Russians was
trying to prove that the Russians had surrendered and had fled all the
way from Ulm while Dlokhov maintained that the Russians had not
surrendered but had beaten the French

We have orders to drive you off here and we shall drive you off said
Dlokhov

Only take care you and your Cossacks are not all captured said the
French grenadier

The French onlookers and listeners laughed

Well make you dance as we did under Suvrov said Dlokhov

 On vous fera danser

Qu estce quil chante asked a Frenchman

 Whats he singing about

Its ancient history said another guessing that it referred to a
former war The Emperor will teach your Suvara as he has taught the
others

Bonaparte began Dlokhov but the Frenchman interrupted him

Not Bonaparte He is the Emperor Sacre nom cried he angrily

The devil skin your Emperor

And Dlokhov swore at him in coarse soldiers Russian and shouldering
his musket walked away

Let us go Ivan Lukich he said to the captain

Ah thats the way to talk French said the picket soldiers Now
Sidorov you have a try

Sidorov turning to the French winked and began to jabber meaningless
sounds very fast Kari mala tafa safi muter Kaska he said
trying to give an expressive intonation to his voice

Ho ho ho Ha ha ha ha Ouh ouh came peals of such healthy and
goodhumored laughter from the soldiers that it infected the French
involuntarily so much so that the only thing left to do seemed to be to
unload the muskets explode the ammunition and all return home as
quickly as possible

But the guns remained loaded the loopholes in blockhouses and
entrenchments looked out just as menacingly and the unlimbered cannon
confronted one another as before





CHAPTER XVI

Having ridden round the whole line from right flank to left Prince
Andrew made his way up to the battery from which the staff officer had
told him the whole field could be seen Here he dismounted and stopped
beside the farthest of the four unlimbered cannon Before the guns an
artillery sentry was pacing up and down he stood at attention when the
officer arrived but at a sign resumed his measured monotonous pacing
Behind the guns were their limbers and still farther back picket ropes
and artillerymens bonfires To the left not far from the farthest
cannon was a small newly constructed wattle shed from which came the
sound of officers voices in eager conversation

It was true that a view over nearly the whole Russian position and the
greater part of the enemys opened out from this battery Just facing
it on the crest of the opposite hill the village of Schon Grabern
could be seen and in three places to left and right the French troops
amid the smoke of their campfires the greater part of whom were
evidently in the village itself and behind the hill To the left from
that village amid the smoke was something resembling a battery but it
was impossible to see it clearly with the naked eye Our right flank was
posted on a rather steep incline which dominated the French position
Our infantry were stationed there and at the farthest point the
dragoons In the center where Tushins battery stood and from which
Prince Andrew was surveying the position was the easiest and most
direct descent and ascent to the brook separating us from Schon Grabern
On the left our troops were close to a copse in which smoked the
bonfires of our infantry who were felling wood The French line was
wider than ours and it was plain that they could easily outflank us on
both sides Behind our position was a steep and deep dip making it
difficult for artillery and cavalry to retire Prince Andrew took out
his notebook and leaning on the cannon sketched a plan of the
position He made some notes on two points intending to mention them to
Bagration His idea was first to concentrate all the artillery in the
center and secondly to withdraw the cavalry to the other side of the
dip Prince Andrew being always near the commander in chief closely
following the mass movements and general orders and constantly studying
historical accounts of battles involuntarily pictured to himself the
course of events in the forthcoming action in broad outline He imagined
only important possibilities If the enemy attacks the right flank he
said to himself the Kiev grenadiers and the Podolsk chasseurs must
hold their position till reserves from the center come up In that case
the dragoons could successfully make a flank counterattack If they
attack our center we having the center battery on this high ground
shall withdraw the left flank under its cover and retreat to the dip by
echelons So he reasoned All the time he had been beside the gun
he had heard the voices of the officers distinctly but as often happens
had not understood a word of what they were saying Suddenly however
he was struck by a voice coming from the shed and its tone was so
sincere that he could not but listen

No friend said a pleasant and as it seemed to Prince Andrew a
familiar voice what I say is that if it were possible to know what is
beyond death none of us would be afraid of it Thats so friend

Another a younger voice interrupted him Afraid or not you cant
escape it anyhow

All the same one is afraid Oh you clever people said a third manly
voice interrupting them both Of course you artillery men are very
wise because you can take everything along with youvodka and snacks

And the owner of the manly voice evidently an infantry officer
laughed

Yes one is afraid continued the first speaker he of the familiar
voice One is afraid of the unknown thats what it is Whatever we may
say about the soul going to the sky we know there is no sky but only
an atmosphere

The manly voice again interrupted the artillery officer

Well stand us some of your herb vodka Tushin it said

Why thought Prince Andrew thats the captain who stood up in the
sutlers hut without his boots He recognized the agreeable
philosophizing voice with pleasure

Some herb vodka Certainly said Tushin But still to conceive a
future life

He did not finish Just then there was a whistle in the air nearer and
nearer faster and louder louder and faster a cannon ball as if it
had not finished saying what was necessary thudded into the ground near
the shed with super human force throwing up a mass of earth The ground
seemed to groan at the terrible impact

And immediately Tushin with a short pipe in the corner of his mouth and
his kind intelligent face rather pale rushed out of the shed followed
by the owner of the manly voice a dashing infantry officer who hurried
off to his company buttoning up his coat as he ran





CHAPTER XVII

Mounting his horse again Prince Andrew lingered with the battery
looking at the puff from the gun that had sent the ball His eyes ran
rapidly over the wide space but he only saw that the hitherto
motionless masses of the French now swayed and that there really was a
battery to their left The smoke above it had not yet dispersed Two
mounted Frenchmen probably adjutants were galloping up the hill A
small but distinctly visible enemy column was moving down the hill
probably to strengthen the front line The smoke of the first shot had
not yet dispersed before another puff appeared followed by a report
The battle had begun Prince Andrew turned his horse and galloped back
to Grunth to find Prince Bagration He heard the cannonade behind him
growing louder and more frequent Evidently our guns had begun to reply
From the bottom of the slope where the parleys had taken place came
the report of musketry

Lemarrois had just arrived at a gallop with Bonapartes stern letter
and Murat humiliated and anxious to expiate his fault had at once
moved his forces to attack the center and outflank both the Russian
wings hoping before evening and before the arrival of the Emperor to
crush the contemptible detachment that stood before him

It has begun Here it is thought Prince Andrew feeling the blood
rush to his heart But where and how will my Toulon present itself

Passing between the companies that had been eating porridge and drinking
vodka a quarter of an hour before he saw everywhere the same rapid
movement of soldiers forming ranks and getting their muskets ready and
on all their faces he recognized the same eagerness that filled his
heart It has begun Here it is dreadful but enjoyable was what the
face of each soldier and each officer seemed to say

Before he had reached the embankments that were being thrown up he saw
in the light of the dull autumn evening mounted men coming toward him
The foremost wearing a Cossack cloak and lambskin cap and riding a
white horse was Prince Bagration Prince Andrew stopped waiting for
him to come up Prince Bagration reined in his horse and recognizing
Prince Andrew nodded to him He still looked ahead while Prince Andrew
told him what he had seen

The feeling It has begun Here it is was seen even on Prince
Bagrations hard brown face with its halfclosed dull sleepy eyes
Prince Andrew gazed with anxious curiosity at that impassive face and
wished he could tell what if anything this man was thinking and
feeling at that moment Is there anything at all behind that impassive
face Prince Andrew asked himself as he looked Prince Bagration bent
his head in sign of agreement with what Prince Andrew told him and
said Very good in a tone that seemed to imply that everything that
took place and was reported to him was exactly what he had foreseen
Prince Andrew out of breath with his rapid ride spoke quickly Prince
Bagration uttering his words with an Oriental accent spoke
particularly slowly as if to impress the fact that there was no need to
hurry However he put his horse to a trot in the direction of Tushins
battery Prince Andrew followed with the suite Behind Prince Bagration
rode an officer of the suite the princes personal adjutant Zherkov
an orderly officer the staff officer on duty riding a fine bobtailed
horse and a civilianan accountant who had asked permission to be
present at the battle out of curiosity The accountant a stout full
faced man looked around him with a nave smile of satisfaction and
presented a strange appearance among the hussars Cossacks and
adjutants in his camlet coat as he jolted on his horse with a convoy
officers saddle

He wants to see a battle said Zherkov to Bolknski pointing to the
accountant but he feels a pain in the pit of his stomach already

Oh leave off said the accountant with a beaming but rather cunning
smile as if flattered at being made the subject of Zherkovs joke and
purposely trying to appear stupider than he really was

It is very strange mon Monsieur Prince said the staff officer He
remembered that in French there is some peculiar way of addressing a
prince but could not get it quite right

By this time they were all approaching Tushins battery and a ball
struck the ground in front of them

Whats that that has fallen asked the accountant with a nave smile

A French pancake answered Zherkov

So thats what they hit with asked the accountant How awful

He seemed to swell with satisfaction He had hardly finished speaking
when they again heard an unexpectedly violent whistling which suddenly
ended with a thud into something soft ffflop and a Cossack riding
a little to their right and behind the accountant crashed to earth with
his horse Zherkov and the staff officer bent over their saddles and
turned their horses away The accountant stopped facing the Cossack
and examined him with attentive curiosity The Cossack was dead but the
horse still struggled

Prince Bagration screwed up his eyes looked round and seeing the
cause of the confusion turned away with indifference as if to say Is
it worth while noticing trifles He reined in his horse with the care
of a skillful rider and slightly bending over disengaged his saber
which had caught in his cloak It was an oldfashioned saber of a kind
no longer in general use Prince Andrew remembered the story of Suvrov
giving his saber to Bagration in Italy and the recollection was
particularly pleasant at that moment They had reached the battery at
which Prince Andrew had been when he examined the battlefield

Whose company asked Prince Bagration of an artilleryman standing by
the ammunition wagon

He asked Whose company but he really meant Are you frightened
here and the artilleryman understood him

Captain Tushins your excellency shouted the redhaired freckled
gunner in a merry voice standing to attention

Yes yes muttered Bagration as if considering something and he rode
past the limbers to the farthest cannon

As he approached a ringing shot issued from it deafening him and his
suite and in the smoke that suddenly surrounded the gun they could see
the gunners who had seized it straining to roll it quickly back to its
former position A huge broadshouldered gunner Number One holding a
mop his legs far apart sprang to the wheel while Number Two with a
trembling hand placed a charge in the cannons mouth The short round
shouldered Captain Tushin stumbling over the tail of the gun carriage
moved forward and not noticing the general looked out shading his eyes
with his small hand

Lift it two lines more and it will be just right cried he in a feeble
voice to which he tried to impart a dashing note illsuited to his weak
figure Number Two he squeaked Fire Medvedev

Bagration called to him and Tushin raising three fingers to his cap
with a bashful and awkward gesture not at all like a military salute but
like a priests benediction approached the general Though Tushins
guns had been intended to cannonade the valley he was firing incendiary
balls at the village of Schon Grabern visible just opposite in front of
which large masses of French were advancing

No one had given Tushin orders where and at what to fire but after
consulting his sergeant major Zakharchenko for whom he had great
respect he had decided that it would be a good thing to set fire to the
village Very good said Bagration in reply to the officers report
and began deliberately to examine the whole battlefield extended before
him The French had advanced nearest on our right Below the height on
which the Kiev regiment was stationed in the hollow where the rivulet
flowed the soulstirring rolling and crackling of musketry was heard
and much farther to the right beyond the dragoons the officer of the
suite pointed out to Bagration a French column that was outflanking us
To the left the horizon bounded by the adjacent wood Prince Bagration
ordered two battalions from the center to be sent to reinforce the right
flank The officer of the suite ventured to remark to the prince that if
these battalions went away the guns would remain without support
Prince Bagration turned to the officer and with his dull eyes looked at
him in silence It seemed to Prince Andrew that the officers remark was
just and that really no answer could be made to it But at that moment
an adjutant galloped up with a message from the commander of the
regiment in the hollow and news that immense masses of the French were
coming down upon them and that his regiment was in disorder and was
retreating upon the Kiev grenadiers Prince Bagration bowed his head in
sign of assent and approval He rode off at a walk to the right and sent
an adjutant to the dragoons with orders to attack the French But this
adjutant returned half an hour later with the news that the commander of
the dragoons had already retreated beyond the dip in the ground as a
heavy fire had been opened on him and he was losing men uselessly and
so had hastened to throw some sharpshooters into the wood

Very good said Bagration

As he was leaving the battery firing was heard on the left also and as
it was too far to the left flank for him to have time to go there
himself Prince Bagration sent Zherkov to tell the general in command
the one who had paraded his regiment before Kutzov at Braunau that he
must retreat as quickly as possible behind the hollow in the rear as
the right flank would probably not be able to withstand the enemys
attack very long About Tushin and the battalion that had been in
support of his battery all was forgotten Prince Andrew listened
attentively to Bagrations colloquies with the commanding officers and
the orders he gave them and to his surprise found that no orders were
really given but that Prince Bagration tried to make it appear that
everything done by necessity by accident or by the will of subordinate
commanders was done if not by his direct command at least in accord
with his intentions Prince Andrew noticed however that though what
happened was due to chance and was independent of the commanders will
owing to the tact Bagration showed his presence was very valuable
Officers who approached him with disturbed countenances became calm
soldiers and officers greeted him gaily grew more cheerful in his
presence and were evidently anxious to display their courage before
him





CHAPTER XVIII

Prince Bagration having reached the highest point of our right flank
began riding downhill to where the roll of musketry was heard but where
on account of the smoke nothing could be seen The nearer they got to
the hollow the less they could see but the more they felt the nearness
of the actual battlefield They began to meet wounded men One with a
bleeding head and no cap was being dragged along by two soldiers who
supported him under the arms There was a gurgle in his throat and he
was spitting blood A bullet had evidently hit him in the throat or
mouth Another was walking sturdily by himself but without his musket
groaning aloud and swinging his arm which had just been hurt while
blood from it was streaming over his greatcoat as from a bottle He had
that moment been wounded and his face showed fear rather than suffering
Crossing a road they descended a steep incline and saw several men lying
on the ground they also met a crowd of soldiers some of whom were
unwounded The soldiers were ascending the hill breathing heavily and
despite the generals presence were talking loudly and gesticulating In
front of them rows of gray cloaks were already visible through the
smoke and an officer catching sight of Bagration rushed shouting after
the crowd of retreating soldiers ordering them back Bagration rode up
to the ranks along which shots crackled now here and now there drowning
the sound of voices and the shouts of command The whole air reeked with
smoke The excited faces of the soldiers were blackened with it Some
were using their ramrods others putting powder on the touchpans or
taking charges from their pouches while others were firing though who
they were firing at could not be seen for the smoke which there was no
wind to carry away A pleasant humming and whistling of bullets were
often heard What is this thought Prince Andrew approaching the crowd
of soldiers It cant be an attack for they are not moving it cant
be a squarefor they are not drawn up for that

The commander of the regiment a thin feeblelooking old man with a
pleasant smilehis eyelids drooping more than half over his old eyes
giving him a mild expression rode up to Bagration and welcomed him as a
host welcomes an honored guest He reported that his regiment had been
attacked by French cavalry and that though the attack had been
repulsed he had lost more than half his men He said the attack had
been repulsed employing this military term to describe what had
occurred to his regiment but in reality he did not himself know what
had happened during that halfhour to the troops entrusted to him and
could not say with certainty whether the attack had been repulsed or his
regiment had been broken up All he knew was that at the commencement of
the action balls and shells began flying all over his regiment and
hitting men and that afterwards someone had shouted Cavalry and our
men had begun firing They were still firing not at the cavalry which
had disappeared but at French infantry who had come into the hollow and
were firing at our men Prince Bagration bowed his head as a sign that
this was exactly what he had desired and expected Turning to his
adjutant he ordered him to bring down the two battalions of the Sixth
Chasseurs whom they had just passed Prince Andrew was struck by the
changed expression on Prince Bagrations face at this moment It
expressed the concentrated and happy resolution you see on the face of a
man who on a hot day takes a final run before plunging into the water
The dull sleepy expression was no longer there nor the affectation of
profound thought The round steady hawks eyes looked before him
eagerly and rather disdainfully not resting on anything although his
movements were still slow and measured

The commander of the regiment turned to Prince Bagration entreating him
to go back as it was too dangerous to remain where they were Please
your excellency for Gods sake he kept saying glancing for support
at an officer of the suite who turned away from him There you see
and he drew attention to the bullets whistling singing and hissing
continually around them He spoke in the tone of entreaty and reproach
that a carpenter uses to a gentleman who has picked up an ax We are
used to it but you sir will blister your hands He spoke as if those
bullets could not kill him and his halfclosed eyes gave still more
persuasiveness to his words The staff officer joined in the colonels
appeals but Bagration did not reply he only gave an order to cease
firing and reform so as to give room for the two approaching
battalions While he was speaking the curtain of smoke that had
concealed the hollow driven by a rising wind began to move from right
to left as if drawn by an invisible hand and the hill opposite with
the French moving about on it opened out before them All eyes fastened
involuntarily on this French column advancing against them and winding
down over the uneven ground One could already see the soldiers shaggy
caps distinguish the officers from the men and see the standard
flapping against its staff

They march splendidly remarked someone in Bagrations suite

The head of the column had already descended into the hollow The clash
would take place on this side of it

The remains of our regiment which had been in action rapidly formed up
and moved to the right from behind it dispersing the laggards came
two battalions of the Sixth Chasseurs in fine order Before they had
reached Bagration the weighty tread of the mass of men marching in step
could be heard On their left flank nearest to Bagration marched a
company commander a fine roundfaced man with a stupid and happy
expressionthe same man who had rushed out of the wattle shed At that
moment he was clearly thinking of nothing but how dashing a fellow he
would appear as he passed the commander

With the selfsatisfaction of a man on parade he stepped lightly with
his muscular legs as if sailing along stretching himself to his full
height without the smallest effort his ease contrasting with the heavy
tread of the soldiers who were keeping step with him He carried close
to his leg a narrow unsheathed sword small curved and not like a real
weapon and looked now at the superior officers and now back at the men
without losing step his whole powerful body turning flexibly It was as
if all the powers of his soul were concentrated on passing the commander
in the best possible manner and feeling that he was doing it well he
was happy Left left left he seemed to repeat to himself at
each alternate step and in time to this with stern but varied faces
the wall of soldiers burdened with knapsacks and muskets marched in
step and each one of these hundreds of soldiers seemed to be repeating
to himself at each alternate step Left left left A fat major
skirted a bush puffing and falling out of step a soldier who had
fallen behind his face showing alarm at his defection ran at a trot
panting to catch up with his company A cannon ball cleaving the air
flew over the heads of Bagration and his suite and fell into the column
to the measure of Left left Close up came the company
commanders voice in jaunty tones The soldiers passed in a semicircle
round something where the ball had fallen and an old trooper on the
flank a noncommissioned officer who had stopped beside the dead men
ran to catch up his line and falling into step with a hop looked back
angrily and through the ominous silence and the regular tramp of feet
beating the ground in unison one seemed to hear left left left

Well done lads said Prince Bagration

Glad to do our best your exlenlency came a confused shout from the
ranks A morose soldier marching on the left turned his eyes on
Bagration as he shouted with an expression that seemed to say We know
that ourselves Another without looking round as though fearing to
relax shouted with his mouth wide open and passed on

The order was given to halt and down knapsacks

Bagration rode round the ranks that had marched past him and dismounted
He gave the reins to a Cossack took off and handed over his felt coat
stretched his legs and set his cap straight The head of the French
column with its officers leading appeared from below the hill

Forward with God said Bagration in a resolute sonorous voice
turning for a moment to the front line and slightly swinging his arms
he went forward uneasily over the rough field with the awkward gait of a
cavalryman Prince Andrew felt that an invisible power was leading him
forward and experienced great happiness

The French were already near Prince Andrew walking beside Bagration
could clearly distinguish their bandoliers red epaulets and even their
faces He distinctly saw an old French officer who with gaitered legs
and turnedout toes climbed the hill with difficulty Prince Bagration
gave no further orders and silently continued to walk on in front of the
ranks Suddenly one shot after another rang out from the French smoke
appeared all along their uneven ranks and musket shots sounded Several
of our men fell among them the roundfaced officer who had marched so
gaily and complacently But at the moment the first report was heard
Bagration looked round and shouted Hurrah

Hurrahahah rang a longdrawn shout from our ranks and passing
Bagration and racing one another they rushed in an irregular but joyous
and eager crowd down the hill at their disordered foe





CHAPTER XIX

The attack of the Sixth Chasseurs secured the retreat of our right
flank In the center Tushins forgotten battery which had managed to
set fire to the Schon Grabern village delayed the French advance The
French were putting out the fire which the wind was spreading and thus
gave us time to retreat The retirement of the center to the other side
of the dip in the ground at the rear was hurried and noisy but the
different companies did not get mixed But our leftwhich consisted of
the Azov and Podolsk infantry and the Pvlograd hussarswas
simultaneously attacked and outflanked by superior French forces under
Lannes and was thrown into confusion Bagration had sent Zherkov to the
general commanding that left flank with orders to retreat immediately

Zherkov not removing his hand from his cap turned his horse about and
galloped off But no sooner had he left Bagration than his courage
failed him He was seized by panic and could not go where it was
dangerous

Having reached the left flank instead of going to the front where the
firing was he began to look for the general and his staff where they
could not possibly be and so did not deliver the order

The command of the left flank belonged by seniority to the commander of
the regiment Kutzov had reviewed at Braunau and in which Dlokhov was
serving as a private But the command of the extreme left flank had been
assigned to the commander of the Pvlograd regiment in which Rostv was
serving and a misunderstanding arose The two commanders were much
exasperated with one another and long after the action had begun on the
right flank and the French were already advancing were engaged in
discussion with the sole object of offending one another But the
regiments both cavalry and infantry were by no means ready for the
impending action From privates to general they were not expecting a
battle and were engaged in peaceful occupations the cavalry feeding the
horses and the infantry collecting wood

He higher iss dan I in rank said the German colonel of the hussars
flushing and addressing an adjutant who had ridden up so let him do
what he vill but I cannot sacrifice my hussars Bugler sount ze
retreat

But haste was becoming imperative Cannon and musketry mingling
together thundered on the right and in the center while the capotes of
Lannes sharpshooters were already seen crossing the milldam and forming
up within twice the range of a musket shot The general in command of
the infantry went toward his horse with jerky steps and having mounted
drew himself up very straight and tall and rode to the Pvlograd
commander The commanders met with polite bows but with secret
malevolence in their hearts

Once again Colonel said the general I cant leave half my men in
the wood I beg of you I beg of you he repeated to occupy the
position and prepare for an attack

I peg of you yourself not to mix in vot is not your business suddenly
replied the irate colonel If you vere in the cavalry

I am not in the cavalry Colonel but I am a Russian general and if you
are not aware of the fact

Quite avare your excellency suddenly shouted the colonel touching
his horse and turning purple in the face Vill you be so goot to come
to ze front and see dat zis position iss no goot I dont vish to
destroy my men for your pleasure

You forget yourself Colonel I am not considering my own pleasure and
I wont allow it to be said

Taking the colonels outburst as a challenge to his courage the general
expanded his chest and rode frowning beside him to the front line as
if their differences would be settled there amongst the bullets They
reached the front several bullets sped over them and they halted in
silence There was nothing fresh to be seen from the line for from
where they had been before it had been evident that it was impossible
for cavalry to act among the bushes and broken ground as well as that
the French were outflanking our left The general and colonel looked
sternly and significantly at one another like two fighting cocks
preparing for battle each vainly trying to detect signs of cowardice in
the other Both passed the examination successfully As there was
nothing to be said and neither wished to give occasion for it to be
alleged that he had been the first to leave the range of fire they
would have remained there for a long time testing each others courage
had it not been that just then they heard the rattle of musketry and a
muffled shout almost behind them in the wood The French had attacked
the men collecting wood in the copse It was no longer possible for the
hussars to retreat with the infantry They were cut off from the line of
retreat on the left by the French However inconvenient the position it
was now necessary to attack in order to cut a way through for
themselves

The squadron in which Rostv was serving had scarcely time to mount
before it was halted facing the enemy Again as at the Enns bridge
there was nothing between the squadron and the enemy and again that
terrible dividing line of uncertainty and fearresembling the line
separating the living from the deadlay between them All were conscious
of this unseen line and the question whether they would cross it or
not and how they would cross it agitated them all

The colonel rode to the front angrily gave some reply to questions put
to him by the officers and like a man desperately insisting on having
his own way gave an order No one said anything definite but the rumor
of an attack spread through the squadron The command to form up rang
out and the sabers whizzed as they were drawn from their scabbards
Still no one moved The troops of the left flank infantry and hussars
alike felt that the commander did not himself know what to do and this
irresolution communicated itself to the men

If only they would be quick thought Rostv feeling that at last the
time had come to experience the joy of an attack of which he had so
often heard from his fellow hussars

Foward with God lads rang out Denisovs voice At a twot
foward

The horses croups began to sway in the front line Rook pulled at the
reins and started of his own accord

Before him on the right Rostv saw the front lines of his hussars and
still farther ahead a dark line which he could not see distinctly but
took to be the enemy Shots could be heard but some way off

Faster came the word of command and Rostv felt Rooks flanks
drooping as he broke into a gallop

Rostv anticipated his horses movements and became more and more
elated He had noticed a solitary tree ahead of him This tree had been
in the middle of the line that had seemed so terribleand now he had
crossed that line and not only was there nothing terrible but
everything was becoming more and more happy and animated Oh how I
will slash at him thought Rostv gripping the hilt of his saber

Huraaaah came a roar of voices Let anyone come my way now
thought Rostv driving his spurs into Rook and letting him go at a full
gallop so that he outstripped the others Ahead the enemy was already
visible Suddenly something like a birch broom seemed to sweep over the
squadron Rostv raised his saber ready to strike but at that instant
the trooper Nikitenko who was galloping ahead shot away from him and
Rostv felt as in a dream that he continued to be carried forward with
unnatural speed but yet stayed on the same spot From behind him
Bondarchuk an hussar he knew jolted against him and looked angrily at
him Bondarchuks horse swerved and galloped past

How is it I am not moving I have fallen I am killed Rostv asked
and answered at the same instant He was alone in the middle of a field
Instead of the moving horses and hussars backs he saw nothing before
him but the motionless earth and the stubble around him There was warm
blood under his arm No I am wounded and the horse is killed Rook
tried to rise on his forelegs but fell back pinning his riders leg
Blood was flowing from his head he struggled but could not rise Rostv
also tried to rise but fell back his sabretache having become entangled
in the saddle Where our men were and where the French he did not
know There was no one near

Having disentangled his leg he rose Where on which side was now the
line that had so sharply divided the two armies he asked himself and
could not answer Can something bad have happened to me he wondered
as he got up and at that moment he felt that something superfluous was
hanging on his benumbed left arm The wrist felt as if it were not his
He examined his hand carefully vainly trying to find blood on it Ah
here are people coming he thought joyfully seeing some men running
toward him They will help me In front came a man wearing a strange
shako and a blue cloak swarthy sunburned and with a hooked nose Then
came two more and many more running behind One of them said something
strange not in Russian In among the hindmost of these men wearing
similar shakos was a Russian hussar He was being held by the arms and
his horse was being led behind him

It must be one of ours a prisoner Yes Can it be that they will take
me too Who are these men thought Rostv scarcely believing his eyes
Can they be French He looked at the approaching Frenchmen and though
but a moment before he had been galloping to get at them and hack them
to pieces their proximity now seemed so awful that he could not believe
his eyes Who are they Why are they running Can they be coming at me
And why To kill me Me whom everyone is so fond of He remembered his
mothers love for him and his familys and his friends and the
enemys intention to kill him seemed impossible But perhaps they may
do it For more than ten seconds he stood not moving from the spot or
realizing the situation The foremost Frenchman the one with the hooked
nose was already so close that the expression of his face could be
seen And the excited alien face of that man his bayonet hanging down
holding his breath and running so lightly frightened Rostv He seized
his pistol and instead of firing it flung it at the Frenchman and ran
with all his might toward the bushes He did not now run with the
feeling of doubt and conflict with which he had trodden the Enns bridge
but with the feeling of a hare fleeing from the hounds One single
sentiment that of fear for his young and happy life possessed his
whole being Rapidly leaping the furrows he fled across the field with
the impetuosity he used to show at catchplay now and then turning his
goodnatured pale young face to look back A shudder of terror went
through him No better not look he thought but having reached the
bushes he glanced round once more The French had fallen behind and
just as he looked round the first man changed his run to a walk and
turning shouted something loudly to a comrade farther back Rostv
paused No theres some mistake thought he They cant have wanted
to kill me But at the same time his left arm felt as heavy as if a
seventypound weight were tied to it He could run no more The
Frenchman also stopped and took aim Rostv closed his eyes and stooped
down One bullet and then another whistled past him He mustered his
last remaining strength took hold of his left hand with his right and
reached the bushes Behind these were some Russian sharpshooters





CHAPTER XX

The infantry regiments that had been caught unawares in the outskirts of
the wood ran out of it the different companies getting mixed and
retreated as a disorderly crowd One soldier in his fear uttered the
senseless cry Cut off that is so terrible in battle and that word
infected the whole crowd with a feeling of panic

Surrounded Cut off Were lost shouted the fugitives

The moment he heard the firing and the cry from behind the general
realized that something dreadful had happened to his regiment and the
thought that he an exemplary officer of many years service who had
never been to blame might be held responsible at headquarters for
negligence or inefficiency so staggered him that forgetting the
recalcitrant cavalry colonel his own dignity as a general and above
all quite forgetting the danger and all regard for selfpreservation he
clutched the crupper of his saddle and spurring his horse galloped to
the regiment under a hail of bullets which fell around but fortunately
missed him His one desire was to know what was happening and at any
cost correct or remedy the mistake if he had made one so that he an
exemplary officer of twentytwo years service who had never been
censured should not be held to blame

Having galloped safely through the French he reached a field behind the
copse across which our men regardless of orders were running and
descending the valley That moment of moral hesitation which decides the
fate of battles had arrived Would this disorderly crowd of soldiers
attend to the voice of their commander or would they disregarding him
continue their flight Despite his desperate shouts that used to seem so
terrible to the soldiers despite his furious purple countenance
distorted out of all likeness to his former self and the flourishing of
his saber the soldiers all continued to run talking firing into the
air and disobeying orders The moral hesitation which decided the fate
of battles was evidently culminating in a panic

The general had a fit of coughing as a result of shouting and of the
powder smoke and stopped in despair Everything seemed lost But at that
moment the French who were attacking suddenly and without any apparent
reason ran back and disappeared from the outskirts and Russian
sharpshooters showed themselves in the copse It was Timkhins company
which alone had maintained its order in the wood and having lain in
ambush in a ditch now attacked the French unexpectedly Timkhin armed
only with a sword had rushed at the enemy with such a desperate cry and
such mad drunken determination that taken by surprise the French had
thrown down their muskets and run Dlokhov running beside Timkhin
killed a Frenchman at close quarters and was the first to seize the
surrendering French officer by his collar Our fugitives returned the
battalions reformed and the French who had nearly cut our left flank
in half were for the moment repulsed Our reserve units were able to
join up and the fight was at an end The regimental commander and Major
Ekonomov had stopped beside a bridge letting the retreating companies
pass by them when a soldier came up and took hold of the commanders
stirrup almost leaning against him The man was wearing a bluish coat
of broadcloth he had no knapsack or cap his head was bandaged and
over his shoulder a French munition pouch was slung He had an officers
sword in his hand The soldier was pale his blue eyes looked impudently
into the commanders face and his lips were smiling Though the
commander was occupied in giving instructions to Major Ekonomov he
could not help taking notice of the soldier

Your excellency here are two trophies said Dlokhov pointing to the
French sword and pouch I have taken an officer prisoner I stopped the
company Dlokhov breathed heavily from weariness and spoke in abrupt
sentences The whole company can bear witness I beg you will remember
this your excellency

All right all right replied the commander and turned to Major
Ekonomov

But Dlokhov did not go away he untied the handkerchief around his
head pulled it off and showed the blood congealed on his hair

A bayonet wound I remained at the front Remember your excellency

Tushins battery had been forgotten and only at the very end of the
action did Prince Bagration still hearing the cannonade in the center
send his orderly staff officer and later Prince Andrew also to order
the battery to retire as quickly as possible When the supports attached
to Tushins battery had been moved away in the middle of the action by
someones order the battery had continued firing and was only not
captured by the French because the enemy could not surmise that anyone
could have the effrontery to continue firing from four quite undefended
guns On the contrary the energetic action of that battery led the
French to suppose that herein the centerthe main Russian forces were
concentrated Twice they had attempted to attack this point but on each
occasion had been driven back by grapeshot from the four isolated guns
on the hillock

Soon after Prince Bagration had left him Tushin had succeeded in
setting fire to Schon Grabern

Look at them scurrying Its burning Just see the smoke Fine Grand
Look at the smoke the smoke exclaimed the artillerymen brightening
up

All the guns without waiting for orders were being fired in the
direction of the conflagration As if urging each other on the soldiers
cried at each shot Fine Thats good Look at it Grand The fire
fanned by the breeze was rapidly spreading The French columns that had
advanced beyond the village went back but as though in revenge for this
failure the enemy placed ten guns to the right of the village and began
firing them at Tushins battery

In their childlike glee aroused by the fire and their luck in
successfully cannonading the French our artillerymen only noticed this
battery when two balls and then four more fell among our guns one
knocking over two horses and another tearing off a munitionwagon
drivers leg Their spirits once roused were however not diminished
but only changed character The horses were replaced by others from a
reserve gun carriage the wounded were carried away and the four guns
were turned against the tengun battery Tushins companion officer had
been killed at the beginning of the engagement and within an hour
seventeen of the forty men of the guns crews had been disabled but the
artillerymen were still as merry and lively as ever Twice they noticed
the French appearing below them and then they fired grapeshot at them

Little Tushin moving feebly and awkwardly kept telling his orderly to
refill my pipe for that one and then scattering sparks from it ran
forward shading his eyes with his small hand to look at the French

Smack at em lads he kept saying seizing the guns by the wheels and
working the screws himself

Amid the smoke deafened by the incessant reports which always made him
jump Tushin not taking his pipe from his mouth ran from gun to gun now
aiming now counting the charges now giving orders about replacing dead
or wounded horses and harnessing fresh ones and shouting in his feeble
voice so high pitched and irresolute His face grew more and more
animated Only when a man was killed or wounded did he frown and turn
away from the sight shouting angrily at the men who as is always the
case hesitated about lifting the injured or dead The soldiers for the
most part handsome fellows and as is always the case in an artillery
company a head and shoulders taller and twice as broad as their
officerall looked at their commander like children in an embarrassing
situation and the expression on his face was invariably reflected on
theirs

Owing to the terrible uproar and the necessity for concentration and
activity Tushin did not experience the slightest unpleasant sense of
fear and the thought that he might be killed or badly wounded never
occurred to him On the contrary he became more and more elated It
seemed to him that it was a very long time ago almost a day since he
had first seen the enemy and fired the first shot and that the corner
of the field he stood on was wellknown and familiar ground Though he
thought of everything considered everything and did everything the
best of officers could do in his position he was in a state akin to
feverish delirium or drunkenness

From the deafening sounds of his own guns around him the whistle and
thud of the enemys cannon balls from the flushed and perspiring faces
of the crew bustling round the guns from the sight of the blood of men
and horses from the little puffs of smoke on the enemys side always
followed by a ball flying past and striking the earth a man a gun a
horse from the sight of all these things a fantastic world of his own
had taken possession of his brain and at that moment afforded him
pleasure The enemys guns were in his fancy not guns but pipes from
which occasional puffs were blown by an invisible smoker

There hes puffing again muttered Tushin to himself as a small
cloud rose from the hill and was borne in a streak to the left by the
wind

Now look out for the ball well throw it back

What do you want your honor asked an artilleryman standing close
by who heard him muttering

Nothing only a shell he answered

Come along our Matvevna he said to himself Matvevna was the
name his fancy gave to the farthest gun of the battery which was large
and of an old pattern The French swarming round their guns seemed to
him like ants In that world the handsome drunkard Number One of the
second guns crew was uncle Tushin looked at him more often than at
anyone else and took delight in his every movement The sound of
musketry at the foot of the hill now diminishing now increasing
seemed like someones breathing He listened intently to the ebb and
flow of these sounds

 Daughter of Matthew

Ah Breathing again breathing he muttered to himself

He imagined himself as an enormously tall powerful man who was throwing
cannon balls at the French with both hands

Now then Matvevna dear old lady dont let me down he was saying as
he moved from the gun when a strange unfamiliar voice called above his
head Captain Tushin Captain

Tushin turned round in dismay It was the staff officer who had turned
him out of the booth at Grunth He was shouting in a gasping voice

Are you mad You have twice been ordered to retreat and you

Why are they down on me thought Tushin looking in alarm at his
superior

I dont he muttered holding up two fingers to his cap I

But the staff officer did not finish what he wanted to say A cannon
ball flying close to him caused him to duck and bend over his horse
He paused and just as he was about to say something more another ball
stopped him He turned his horse and galloped off

Retire All to retire he shouted from a distance

The soldiers laughed A moment later an adjutant arrived with the same
order

It was Prince Andrew The first thing he saw on riding up to the space
where Tushins guns were stationed was an unharnessed horse with a
broken leg that lay screaming piteously beside the harnessed horses
Blood was gushing from its leg as from a spring Among the limbers lay
several dead men One ball after another passed over as he approached
and he felt a nervous shudder run down his spine But the mere thought
of being afraid roused him again I cannot be afraid thought he and
dismounted slowly among the guns He delivered the order and did not
leave the battery He decided to have the guns removed from their
positions and withdrawn in his presence Together with Tushin stepping
across the bodies and under a terrible fire from the French he attended
to the removal of the guns

A staff officer was here a minute ago but skipped off said an
artilleryman to Prince Andrew Not like your honor

Prince Andrew said nothing to Tushin They were both so busy as to seem
not to notice one another When having limbered up the only two cannon
that remained uninjured out of the four they began moving down the hill
one shattered gun and one unicorn were left behind Prince Andrew rode
up to Tushin

Well till we meet again he said holding out his hand to Tushin

Goodbye my dear fellow said Tushin Dear soul Goodbye my dear
fellow and for some unknown reason tears suddenly filled his eyes





CHAPTER XXI

The wind had fallen and black clouds merging with the powder smoke
hung low over the field of battle on the horizon It was growing dark
and the glow of two conflagrations was the more conspicuous The
cannonade was dying down but the rattle of musketry behind and on the
right sounded oftener and nearer As soon as Tushin with his guns
continually driving round or coming upon wounded men was out of range
of fire and had descended into the dip he was met by some of the staff
among them the staff officer and Zherkov who had been twice sent to
Tushins battery but had never reached it Interrupting one another
they all gave and transmitted orders as to how to proceed
reprimanding and reproaching him Tushin gave no orders and
silentlyfearing to speak because at every word he felt ready to weep
without knowing whyrode behind on his artillery nag Though the orders
were to abandon the wounded many of them dragged themselves after
troops and begged for seats on the gun carriages The jaunty infantry
officer who just before the battle had rushed out of Tushins wattle
shed was laid with a bullet in his stomach on Matvevnas carriage
At the foot of the hill a pale hussar cadet supporting one hand with
the other came up to Tushin and asked for a seat

Captain for Gods sake Ive hurt my arm he said timidly For Gods
sake I cant walk For Gods sake

It was plain that this cadet had already repeatedly asked for a lift and
been refused He asked in a hesitating piteous voice

Tell them to give me a seat for Gods sake

Give him a seat said Tushin Lay a cloak for him to sit on lad he
said addressing his favorite soldier And where is the wounded
officer

He has been set down He died replied someone

Help him up Sit down dear fellow sit down Spread out the cloak
Antonov

The cadet was Rostv With one hand he supported the other he was pale
and his jaw trembled shivering feverishly He was placed on Matvevna
the gun from which they had removed the dead officer The cloak they
spread under him was wet with blood which stained his breeches and arm

What are you wounded my lad said Tushin approaching the gun on
which Rostv sat

No its a sprain

Then what is this blood on the gun carriage inquired Tushin

It was the officer your honor stained it answered the artilleryman
wiping away the blood with his coat sleeve as if apologizing for the
state of his gun

It was all that they could do to get the guns up the rise aided by the
infantry and having reached the village of Gruntersdorf they halted It
had grown so dark that one could not distinguish the uniforms ten paces
off and the firing had begun to subside Suddenly near by on the
right shouting and firing were again heard Flashes of shot gleamed in
the darkness This was the last French attack and was met by soldiers
who had sheltered in the village houses They all rushed out of the
village again but Tushins guns could not move and the artillerymen
Tushin and the cadet exchanged silent glances as they awaited their
fate The firing died down and soldiers talking eagerly streamed out
of a side street

Not hurt Petrov asked one

Weve given it em hot mate They wont make another push now said
another

You couldnt see a thing How they shot at their own fellows Nothing
could be seen Pitchdark brother Isnt there something to drink

The French had been repulsed for the last time And again and again in
the complete darkness Tushins guns moved forward surrounded by the
humming infantry as by a frame

In the darkness it seemed as though a gloomy unseen river was flowing
always in one direction humming with whispers and talk and the sound of
hoofs and wheels Amid the general rumble the groans and voices of the
wounded were more distinctly heard than any other sound in the darkness
of the night The gloom that enveloped the army was filled with their
groans which seemed to melt into one with the darkness of the night
After a while the moving mass became agitated someone rode past on a
white horse followed by his suite and said something in passing What
did he say Where to now Halt is it Did he thank us came eager
questions from all sides The whole moving mass began pressing closer
together and a report spread that they were ordered to halt evidently
those in front had halted All remained where they were in the middle of
the muddy road

Fires were lighted and the talk became more audible Captain Tushin
having given orders to his company sent a soldier to find a dressing
station or a doctor for the cadet and sat down by a bonfire the
soldiers had kindled on the road Rostv too dragged himself to the
fire From pain cold and damp a feverish shivering shook his whole
body Drowsiness was irresistibly mastering him but he kept awake by an
excruciating pain in his arm for which he could find no satisfactory
position He kept closing his eyes and then again looking at the fire
which seemed to him dazzlingly red and at the feeble roundshouldered
figure of Tushin who was sitting crosslegged like a Turk beside him
Tushins large kind intelligent eyes were fixed with sympathy and
commiseration on Rostv who saw that Tushin with his whole heart wished
to help him but could not

From all sides were heard the footsteps and talk of the infantry who
were walking driving past and settling down all around The sound of
voices the tramping feet the horses hoofs moving in mud the
crackling of wood fires near and afar merged into one tremulous rumble

It was no longer as before a dark unseen river flowing through the
gloom but a dark sea swelling and gradually subsiding after a storm
Rostv looked at and listened listlessly to what passed before and
around him An infantryman came to the fire squatted on his heels held
his hands to the blaze and turned away his face

You dont mind your honor he asked Tushin Ive lost my company
your honor I dont know where such bad luck

With the soldier an infantry officer with a bandaged cheek came up to
the bonfire and addressing Tushin asked him to have the guns moved a
trifle to let a wagon go past After he had gone two soldiers rushed to
the campfire They were quarreling and fighting desperately each trying
to snatch from the other a boot they were both holding on to

You picked it up I dare say Youre very smart one of them
shouted hoarsely

Then a thin pale soldier his neck bandaged with a bloodstained leg
band came up and in angry tones asked the artillerymen for water

Must one die like a dog said he

Tushin told them to give the man some water Then a cheerful soldier ran
up begging a little fire for the infantry

A nice little hot torch for the infantry Good luck to you fellow
countrymen Thanks for the firewell return it with interest said he
carrying away into the darkness a glowing stick

Next came four soldiers carrying something heavy on a cloak and passed
by the fire One of them stumbled

Who the devil has put the logs on the road snarled he

Hes deadwhy carry him said another

Shut up

And they disappeared into the darkness with their load

Still aching Tushin asked Rostv in a whisper

Yes

Your honor youre wanted by the general He is in the hut here said
a gunner coming up to Tushin

Coming friend

Tushin rose and buttoning his greatcoat and pulling it straight walked
away from the fire

Not far from the artillery campfire in a hut that had been prepared for
him Prince Bagration sat at dinner talking with some commanding
officers who had gathered at his quarters The little old man with the
halfclosed eyes was there greedily gnawing a mutton bone and the
general who had served blamelessly for twentytwo years flushed by a
glass of vodka and the dinner and the staff officer with the signet
ring and Zherkov uneasily glancing at them all and Prince Andrew
pale with compressed lips and feverishly glittering eyes

In a corner of the hut stood a standard captured from the French and
the accountant with the nave face was feeling its texture shaking his
head in perplexityperhaps because the banner really interested him
perhaps because it was hard for him hungry as he was to look on at a
dinner where there was no place for him In the next hut there was a
French colonel who had been taken prisoner by our dragoons Our officers
were flocking in to look at him Prince Bagration was thanking the
individual commanders and inquiring into details of the action and our
losses The general whose regiment had been inspected at Braunau was
informing the prince that as soon as the action began he had withdrawn
from the wood mustered the men who were woodcutting and allowing the
French to pass him had made a bayonet charge with two battalions and
had broken up the French troops

When I saw your excellency that their first battalion was
disorganized I stopped in the road and thought Ill let them come on
and will meet them with the fire of the whole battalionand thats what
I did

The general had so wished to do this and was so sorry he had not managed
to do it that it seemed to him as if it had really happened Perhaps it
might really have been so Could one possibly make out amid all that
confusion what did or did not happen

By the way your excellency I should inform you he
continuedremembering Dlokhovs conversation with Kutzov and his last
interview with the gentlemanrankerthat Private Dlokhov who was
reduced to the ranks took a French officer prisoner in my presence and
particularly distinguished himself

I saw the Pvlograd hussars attack there your excellency chimed in
Zherkov looking uneasily around He had not seen the hussars all that
day but had heard about them from an infantry officer They broke up
two squares your excellency

Several of those present smiled at Zherkovs words expecting one of his
usual jokes but noticing that what he was saying redounded to the glory
of our arms and of the days work they assumed a serious expression
though many of them knew that what he was saying was a lie devoid of any
foundation Prince Bagration turned to the old colonel

Gentlemen I thank you all all arms have behaved heroically infantry
cavalry and artillery How was it that two guns were abandoned in the
center he inquired searching with his eyes for someone Prince
Bagration did not ask about the guns on the left flank he knew that all
the guns there had been abandoned at the very beginning of the action
I think I sent you he added turning to the staff officer on duty

One was damaged answered the staff officer and the other I cant
understand I was there all the time giving orders and had only just
left It is true that it was hot there he added modestly

Someone mentioned that Captain Tushin was bivouacking close to the
village and had already been sent for

Oh but you were there said Prince Bagration addressing Prince
Andrew

Of course we only just missed one another said the staff officer
with a smile to Bolknski

I had not the pleasure of seeing you said Prince Andrew coldly and
abruptly

All were silent Tushin appeared at the threshold and made his way
timidly from behind the backs of the generals As he stepped past the
generals in the crowded hut feeling embarrassed as he always was by the
sight of his superiors he did not notice the staff of the banner and
stumbled over it Several of those present laughed

How was it a gun was abandoned asked Bagration frowning not so much
at the captain as at those who were laughing among whom Zherkov laughed
loudest

Only now when he was confronted by the stern authorities did his guilt
and the disgrace of having lost two guns and yet remaining alive present
themselves to Tushin in all their horror He had been so excited that he
had not thought about it until that moment The officers laughter
confused him still more He stood before Bagration with his lower jaw
trembling and was hardly able to mutter I dont know your
excellency I had no men your excellency

You might have taken some from the covering troops

Tushin did not say that there were no covering troops though that was
perfectly true He was afraid of getting some other officer into
trouble and silently fixed his eyes on Bagration as a schoolboy who has
blundered looks at an examiner

The silence lasted some time Prince Bagration apparently not wishing
to be severe found nothing to say the others did not venture to
intervene Prince Andrew looked at Tushin from under his brows and his
fingers twitched nervously

Your excellency Prince Andrew broke the silence with his abrupt
voice you were pleased to send me to Captain Tushins battery I went
there and found two thirds of the men and horses knocked out two guns
smashed and no supports at all

Prince Bagration and Tushin looked with equal intentness at Bolknski
who spoke with suppressed agitation

And if your excellency will allow me to express my opinion he
continued we owe todays success chiefly to the action of that battery
and the heroic endurance of Captain Tushin and his company and without
awaiting a reply Prince Andrew rose and left the table

Prince Bagration looked at Tushin evidently reluctant to show distrust
in Bolknskis emphatic opinion yet not feeling able fully to credit it
bent his head and told Tushin that he could go Prince Andrew went out
with him

Thank you you saved me my dear fellow said Tushin

Prince Andrew gave him a look but said nothing and went away He felt
sad and depressed It was all so strange so unlike what he had hoped

Who are they Why are they here What do they want And when will all
this end thought Rostv looking at the changing shadows before him
The pain in his arm became more and more intense Irresistible
drowsiness overpowered him red rings danced before his eyes and the
impression of those voices and faces and a sense of loneliness merged
with the physical pain It was they these soldierswounded and
unwoundedit was they who were crushing weighing down and twisting the
sinews and scorching the flesh of his sprained arm and shoulder To rid
himself of them he closed his eyes

For a moment he dozed but in that short interval innumerable things
appeared to him in a dream his mother and her large white hand Snyas
thin little shoulders Natshas eyes and laughter Denisov with his
voice and mustache and Telyanin and all that affair with Telyanin and
Bogdanich That affair was the same thing as this soldier with the harsh
voice and it was that affair and this soldier that were so agonizingly
incessantly pulling and pressing his arm and always dragging it in one
direction He tried to get away from them but they would not for an
instant let his shoulder move a hairs breadth It would not acheit
would be wellif only they did not pull it but it was impossible to get
rid of them

He opened his eyes and looked up The black canopy of night hung less
than a yard above the glow of the charcoal Flakes of falling snow were
fluttering in that light Tushin had not returned the doctor had not
come He was alone now except for a soldier who was sitting naked at
the other side of the fire warming his thin yellow body

Nobody wants me thought Rostv There is no one to help me or pity
me Yet I was once at home strong happy and loved He sighed and
doing so groaned involuntarily

Eh is anything hurting you asked the soldier shaking his shirt out
over the fire and not waiting for an answer he gave a grunt and added
What a lot of men have been crippled todayfrightful

Rostv did not listen to the soldier He looked at the snowflakes
fluttering above the fire and remembered a Russian winter at his warm
bright home his fluffy fur coat his quickly gliding sleigh his
healthy body and all the affection and care of his family And why did
I come here he wondered

Next day the French army did not renew their attack and the remnant of
Bagrations detachment was reunited to Kutzovs army





BOOK THREE 1805





CHAPTER I

Prince Vasli was not a man who deliberately thought out his plans
Still less did he think of injuring anyone for his own advantage He was
merely a man of the world who had got on and to whom getting on had
become a habit Schemes and devices for which he never rightly accounted
to himself but which formed the whole interest of his life were
constantly shaping themselves in his mind arising from the
circumstances and persons he met Of these plans he had not merely one
or two in his head but dozens some only beginning to form themselves
some approaching achievement and some in course of disintegration He
did not for instance say to himself This man now has influence I
must gain his confidence and friendship and through him obtain a special
grant Nor did he say to himself Pierre is a rich man I must entice
him to marry my daughter and lend me the forty thousand rubles I need
But when he came across a man of position his instinct immediately told
him that this man could be useful and without any premeditation Prince
Vasli took the first opportunity to gain his confidence flatter him
become intimate with him and finally make his request

He had Pierre at hand in Moscow and procured for him an appointment as
Gentleman of the Bedchamber which at that time conferred the status of
Councilor of State and insisted on the young man accompanying him to
Petersburg and staying at his house With apparent absentmindedness
yet with unhesitating assurance that he was doing the right thing
Prince Vasli did everything to get Pierre to marry his daughter Had he
thought out his plans beforehand he could not have been so natural and
shown such unaffected familiarity in intercourse with everybody both
above and below him in social standing Something always drew him toward
those richer and more powerful than himself and he had rare skill in
seizing the most opportune moment for making use of people

Pierre on unexpectedly becoming Count Bezkhov and a rich man felt
himself after his recent loneliness and freedom from cares so beset and
preoccupied that only in bed was he able to be by himself He had to
sign papers to present himself at government offices the purpose of
which was not clear to him to question his chief steward to visit his
estate near Moscow and to receive many people who formerly did not even
wish to know of his existence but would now have been offended and
grieved had he chosen not to see them These different
peoplebusinessmen relations and acquaintances alikewere all disposed
to treat the young heir in the most friendly and flattering manner they
were all evidently firmly convinced of Pierres noble qualities He was
always hearing such words as With your remarkable kindness or With
your excellent heart You are yourself so honorable Count or Were
he as clever as you and so on till he began sincerely to believe in
his own exceptional kindness and extraordinary intelligence the more so
as in the depth of his heart it had always seemed to him that he really
was very kind and intelligent Even people who had formerly been
spiteful toward him and evidently unfriendly now became gentle and
affectionate The angry eldest princess with the long waist and hair
plastered down like a dolls had come into Pierres room after the
funeral With drooping eyes and frequent blushes she told him she was
very sorry about their past misunderstandings and did not now feel she
had a right to ask him for anything except only for permission after
the blow she had received to remain for a few weeks longer in the house
she so loved and where she had sacrificed so much She could not refrain
from weeping at these words Touched that this statuesque princess could
so change Pierre took her hand and begged her forgiveness without
knowing what for From that day the eldest princess quite changed toward
Pierre and began knitting a striped scarf for him

Do this for my sake mon cher after all she had to put up with a
great deal from the deceased said Prince Vasli to him handing him a
deed to sign for the princess benefit

Prince Vasli had come to the conclusion that it was necessary to throw
this bonea bill for thirty thousand rublesto the poor princess that it
might not occur to her to speak of his share in the affair of the inlaid
portfolio Pierre signed the deed and after that the princess grew still
kinder The younger sisters also became affectionate to him especially
the youngest the pretty one with the mole who often made him feel
confused by her smiles and her own confusion when meeting him

It seemed so natural to Pierre that everyone should like him and it
would have seemed so unnatural had anyone disliked him that he could
not but believe in the sincerity of those around him Besides he had no
time to ask himself whether these people were sincere or not He was
always busy and always felt in a state of mild and cheerful
intoxication He felt as though he were the center of some important and
general movement that something was constantly expected of him that if
he did not do it he would grieve and disappoint many people but if he
did this and that all would be well and he did what was demanded of
him but still that happy result always remained in the future

More than anyone else Prince Vasli took possession of Pierres affairs
and of Pierre himself in those early days From the death of Count
Bezkhov he did not let go his hold of the lad He had the air of a man
oppressed by business weary and suffering who yet would not for
pitys sake leave this helpless youth who after all was the son of
his old friend and the possessor of such enormous wealth to the caprice
of fate and the designs of rogues During the few days he spent in
Moscow after the death of Count Bezkhov he would call Pierre or go to
him himself and tell him what ought to be done in a tone of weariness
and assurance as if he were adding every time You know I am
overwhelmed with business and it is purely out of charity that I trouble
myself about you and you also know quite well that what I propose is
the only thing possible

Well my dear fellow tomorrow we are off at last said Prince Vasli
one day closing his eyes and fingering Pierres elbow speaking as if
he were saying something which had long since been agreed upon and could
not now be altered We start tomorrow and Im giving you a place in my
carriage I am very glad All our important business here is now
settled and I ought to have been off long ago Here is something I have
received from the chancellor I asked him for you and you have been
entered in the diplomatic corps and made a Gentleman of the Bedchamber
The diplomatic career now lies open before you

Notwithstanding the tone of wearied assurance with which these words
were pronounced Pierre who had so long been considering his career
wished to make some suggestion But Prince Vasli interrupted him in the
special deep cooing tone precluding the possibility of interrupting his
speech which he used in extreme cases when special persuasion was
needed

Mais mon cher I did this for my own sake to satisfy my conscience
and there is nothing to thank me for No one has ever complained yet of
being too much loved and besides you are free you could throw it up
tomorrow But you will see everything for yourself when you get to
Petersburg It is high time for you to get away from these terrible
recollections Prince Vasli sighed Yes yes my boy And my valet
can go in your carriage Ah I was nearly forgetting he added You
know mon cher your father and I had some accounts to settle so I have
received what was due from the Ryazan estate and will keep it you wont
require it Well go into the accounts later

By what was due from the Ryazan estate Prince Vasli meant several
thousand rubles quitrent received from Pierres peasants which the
prince had retained for himself

In Petersburg as in Moscow Pierre found the same atmosphere of
gentleness and affection He could not refuse the post or rather the
rank for he did nothing that Prince Vasli had procured for him and
acquaintances invitations and social occupations were so numerous
that even more than in Moscow he felt a sense of bewilderment bustle
and continual expectation of some good always in front of him but never
attained

Of his former bachelor acquaintances many were no longer in Petersburg
The Guards had gone to the front Dlokhov had been reduced to the
ranks Anatole was in the army somewhere in the provinces Prince Andrew
was abroad so Pierre had not the opportunity to spend his nights as he
used to like to spend them or to open his mind by intimate talks with a
friend older than himself and whom he respected His whole time was
taken up with dinners and balls and was spent chiefly at Prince Vaslis
house in the company of the stout princess his wife and his beautiful
daughter Hlne

Like the others Anna Pvlovna Schrer showed Pierre the change of
attitude toward him that had taken place in society

Formerly in Anna Pvlovnas presence Pierre had always felt that what
he was saying was out of place tactless and unsuitable that remarks
which seemed to him clever while they formed in his mind became foolish
as soon as he uttered them while on the contrary Hippolytes stupidest
remarks came out clever and apt Now everything Pierre said was
charmant Even if Anna Pvlovna did not say so he could see that she
wished to and only refrained out of regard for his modesty

In the beginning of the winter of 18056 Pierre received one of Anna
Pvlovnas usual pink notes with an invitation to which was added You
will find the beautiful Hlne here whom it is always delightful to
see

When he read that sentence Pierre felt for the first time that some
link which other people recognized had grown up between himself and
Hlne and that thought both alarmed him as if some obligation were
being imposed on him which he could not fulfill and pleased him as an
entertaining supposition

Anna Pvlovnas At Home was like the former one only the novelty she
offered her guests this time was not Mortemart but a diplomatist fresh
from Berlin with the very latest details of the Emperor Alexanders
visit to Potsdam and of how the two august friends had pledged
themselves in an indissoluble alliance to uphold the cause of justice
against the enemy of the human race Anna Pvlovna received Pierre with
a shade of melancholy evidently relating to the young mans recent loss
by the death of Count Bezkhov everyone constantly considered it a duty
to assure Pierre that he was greatly afflicted by the death of the
father he had hardly known and her melancholy was just like the august
melancholy she showed at the mention of her most august Majesty the
Empress Mrya Fdorovna Pierre felt flattered by this Anna Pvlovna
arranged the different groups in her drawing room with her habitual
skill The large group in which were Prince Vasli and the generals
had the benefit of the diplomat Another group was at the tea table
Pierre wished to join the former but Anna Pvlovnawho was in the
excited condition of a commander on a battlefield to whom thousands of
new and brilliant ideas occur which there is hardly time to put in
actionseeing Pierre touched his sleeve with her finger saying

Wait a bit I have something in view for you this evening She
glanced at Hlne and smiled at her My dear Hlne be charitable to
my poor aunt who adores you Go and keep her company for ten minutes
And that it will not be too dull here is the dear count who will not
refuse to accompany you

The beauty went to the aunt but Anna Pvlovna detained Pierre looking
as if she had to give some final necessary instructions

Isnt she exquisite she said to Pierre pointing to the stately
beauty as she glided away And how she carries herself For so young a
girl such tact such masterly perfection of manner It comes from her
heart Happy the man who wins her With her the least worldly of men
would occupy a most brilliant position in society Dont you think so I
only wanted to know your opinion and Anna Pvlovna let Pierre go

Pierre in reply sincerely agreed with her as to Hlnes perfection of
manner If he ever thought of Hlne it was just of her beauty and her
remarkable skill in appearing silently dignified in society

The old aunt received the two young people in her corner but seemed
desirous of hiding her adoration for Hlne and inclined rather to show
her fear of Anna Pvlovna She looked at her niece as if inquiring what
she was to do with these people On leaving them Anna Pvlovna again
touched Pierres sleeve saying I hope you wont say that it is dull
in my house again and she glanced at Hlne

Hlne smiled with a look implying that she did not admit the
possibility of anyone seeing her without being enchanted The aunt
coughed swallowed and said in French that she was very pleased to see
Hlne then she turned to Pierre with the same words of welcome and the
same look In the middle of a dull and halting conversation Hlne
turned to Pierre with the beautiful bright smile that she gave to
everyone Pierre was so used to that smile and it had so little meaning
for him that he paid no attention to it The aunt was just speaking of
a collection of snuffboxes that had belonged to Pierres father Count
Bezkhov and showed them her own box Princess Hlne asked to see the
portrait of the aunts husband on the box lid

That is probably the work of Vinesse said Pierre mentioning a
celebrated miniaturist and he leaned over the table to take the
snuffbox while trying to hear what was being said at the other table

He half rose meaning to go round but the aunt handed him the snuffbox
passing it across Hlnes back Hlne stooped forward to make room
and looked round with a smile She was as always at evening parties
wearing a dress such as was then fashionable cut very low at front and
back Her bust which had always seemed like marble to Pierre was so
close to him that his shortsighted eyes could not but perceive the
living charm of her neck and shoulders so near to his lips that he need
only have bent his head a little to have touched them He was conscious
of the warmth of her body the scent of perfume and the creaking of her
corset as she moved He did not see her marble beauty forming a complete
whole with her dress but all the charm of her body only covered by her
garments And having once seen this he could not help being aware of it
just as we cannot renew an illusion we have once seen through

So you have never noticed before how beautiful I am Hlne seemed to
say You had not noticed that I am a woman Yes I am a woman who may
belong to anyoneto you too said her glance And at that moment Pierre
felt that Hlne not only could but must be his wife and that it
could not be otherwise

He knew this at that moment as surely as if he had been standing at the
altar with her How and when this would be he did not know he did not
even know if it would be a good thing he even felt he knew not why
that it would be a bad thing but he knew it would happen

Pierre dropped his eyes lifted them again and wished once more to see
her as a distant beauty far removed from him as he had seen her every
day until then but he could no longer do it He could not any more
than a man who has been looking at a tuft of steppe grass through the
mist and taking it for a tree can again take it for a tree after he has
once recognized it to be a tuft of grass She was terribly close to him
She already had power over him and between them there was no longer any
barrier except the barrier of his own will

Well I will leave you in your little corner came Anna Pvlovnas
voice I see you are all right there

And Pierre anxiously trying to remember whether he had done anything
reprehensible looked round with a blush It seemed to him that everyone
knew what had happened to him as he knew it himself

A little later when he went up to the large circle Anna Pvlovna said
to him I hear you are refitting your Petersburg house

This was true The architect had told him that it was necessary and
Pierre without knowing why was having his enormous Petersburg house
done up

Thats a good thing but dont move from Prince Vaslis It is good to
have a friend like the prince she said smiling at Prince Vasli I
know something about that Dont I And you are still so young You need
advice Dont be angry with me for exercising an old womans privilege

She paused as women always do expecting something after they have
mentioned their age If you marry it will be a different thing she
continued uniting them both in one glance Pierre did not look at
Hlne nor she at him But she was just as terribly close to him He
muttered something and colored

When he got home he could not sleep for a long time for thinking of what
had happened What had happened Nothing He had merely understood that
the woman he had known as a child of whom when her beauty was mentioned
he had said absentmindedly Yes shes good looking he had
understood that this woman might belong to him

But shes stupid I have myself said she is stupid he thought There
is something nasty something wrong in the feeling she excites in me I
have been told that her brother Anatole was in love with her and she
with him that there was quite a scandal and that thats why he was sent
away Hippolyte is her brother Prince Vasli is her father Its
bad he reflected but while he was thinking this the reflection
was still incomplete he caught himself smiling and was conscious that
another line of thought had sprung up and while thinking of her
worthlessness he was also dreaming of how she would be his wife how she
would love him become quite different and how all he had thought and
heard of her might be false And he again saw her not as the daughter of
Prince Vasli but visualized her whole body only veiled by its gray
dress But no Why did this thought never occur to me before and
again he told himself that it was impossible that there would be
something unnatural and as it seemed to him dishonorable in this
marriage He recalled her former words and looks and the words and looks
of those who had seen them together He recalled Anna Pvlovnas words
and looks when she spoke to him about his house recalled thousands of
such hints from Prince Vasli and others and was seized by terror lest
he had already in some way bound himself to do something that was
evidently wrong and that he ought not to do But at the very time he was
expressing this conviction to himself in another part of his mind her
image rose in all its womanly beauty





CHAPTER II

In November 1805 Prince Vasli had to go on a tour of inspection in
four different provinces He had arranged this for himself so as to
visit his neglected estates at the same time and pick up his son Anatole
where his regiment was stationed and take him to visit Prince Nicholas
Bolknski in order to arrange a match for him with the daughter of that
rich old man But before leaving home and undertaking these new affairs
Prince Vasli had to settle matters with Pierre who it is true had
latterly spent whole days at home that is in Prince Vaslis house
where he was staying and had been absurd excited and foolish in
Hlnes presence as a lover should be but had not yet proposed to
her

This is all very fine but things must be settled said Prince Vasli
to himself with a sorrowful sigh one morning feeling that Pierre who
was under such obligations to him But never mind that was not
behaving very well in this matter Youth frivolity well God be
with him thought he relishing his own goodness of heart but it must
be brought to a head The day after tomorrow will be Lelyas name day I
will invite two or three people and if he does not understand what he
ought to do then it will be my affairyes my affair I am her father

Six weeks after Anna Pvlovnas At Home and after the sleepless night
when he had decided that to marry Hlne would be a calamity and that he
ought to avoid her and go away Pierre despite that decision had not
left Prince Vaslis and felt with terror that in peoples eyes he was
every day more and more connected with her that it was impossible for
him to return to his former conception of her that he could not break
away from her and that though it would be a terrible thing he would
have to unite his fate with hers He might perhaps have been able to
free himself but that Prince Vasli who had rarely before given
receptions now hardly let a day go by without having an evening party
at which Pierre had to be present unless he wished to spoil the general
pleasure and disappoint everyones expectation Prince Vasli in the
rare moments when he was at home would take Pierres hand in passing
and draw it downwards or absentmindedly hold out his wrinkled clean
shaven cheek for Pierre to kiss and would say Till tomorrow or Be
in to dinner or I shall not see you or I am staying in for your
sake and so on And though Prince Vasli when he stayed in as he
said for Pierres sake hardly exchanged a couple of words with him
Pierre felt unable to disappoint him Every day he said to himself one
and the same thing It is time I understood her and made up my mind
what she really is Was I mistaken before or am I mistaken now No she
is not stupid she is an excellent girl he sometimes said to himself
she never makes a mistake never says anything stupid She says little
but what she does say is always clear and simple so she is not stupid
She never was abashed and is not abashed now so she cannot be a bad
woman He had often begun to make reflections or think aloud in her
company and she had always answered him either by a brief but
appropriate remarkshowing that it did not interest heror by a silent
look and smile which more palpably than anything else showed Pierre her
superiority She was right in regarding all arguments as nonsense in
comparison with that smile

She always addressed him with a radiantly confiding smile meant for him
alone in which there was something more significant than in the general
smile that usually brightened her face Pierre knew that everyone was
waiting for him to say a word and cross a certain line and he knew that
sooner or later he would step across it but an incomprehensible terror
seized him at the thought of that dreadful step A thousand times during
that month and a half while he felt himself drawn nearer and nearer to
that dreadful abyss Pierre said to himself What am I doing I need
resolution Can it be that I have none

He wished to take a decision but felt with dismay that in this matter
he lacked that strength of will which he had known in himself and really
possessed Pierre was one of those who are only strong when they feel
themselves quite innocent and since that day when he was overpowered by
a feeling of desire while stooping over the snuffbox at Anna Pvlovnas
an unacknowledged sense of the guilt of that desire paralyzed his will

On Hlnes name day a small party of just their own peopleas his wife
saidmet for supper at Prince Vaslis All these friends and relations
had been given to understand that the fate of the young girl would be
decided that evening The visitors were seated at supper Princess
Kurgina a portly imposing woman who had once been handsome was
sitting at the head of the table On either side of her sat the more
important guestsan old general and his wife and Anna Pvlovna Schrer
At the other end sat the younger and less important guests and there
too sat the members of the family and Pierre and Hlne side by side
Prince Vasli was not having any supper he went round the table in a
merry mood sitting down now by one now by another of the guests To
each of them he made some careless and agreeable remark except to Pierre
and Hlne whose presence he seemed not to notice He enlivened the
whole party The wax candles burned brightly the silver and crystal
gleamed so did the ladies toilets and the gold and silver of the mens
epaulets servants in scarlet liveries moved round the table the
clatter of plates knives and glasses mingled with the animated hum of
several conversations At one end of the table the old chamberlain was
heard assuring an old baroness that he loved her passionately at which
she laughed at the other could be heard the story of the misfortunes of
some Mary Viktorovna or other At the center of the table Prince Vasli
attracted everybodys attention With a facetious smile on his face he
was telling the ladies about last Wednesdays meeting of the Imperial
Council at which Sergey Kuzmich Vyazmitinov the new military governor
general of Petersburg had received and read the then famous rescript of
the Emperor Alexander from the army to Sergey Kuzmich in which the
Emperor said that he was receiving from all sides declarations of the
peoples loyalty that the declaration from Petersburg gave him
particular pleasure and that he was proud to be at the head of such a
nation and would endeavor to be worthy of it This rescript began with
the words Sergey Kuzmich From all sides reports reach me etc

Well and so he never got farther than Sergey Kuzmich asked one of
the ladies

Exactly not a hairs breadth farther answered Prince Vasli
laughing Sergey Kuzmich From all sides From all sides Sergey
Kuzmich Poor Vyazmitinov could not get any farther He began the
rescript again and again but as soon as he uttered Sergey he sobbed
Kuzmich tears and From all sides was smothered in sobs and he
could get no farther And again his handkerchief and again Sergey
Kuzmich From all sides and tears till at last somebody else was
asked to read it

Kuzmich From all sides and then tears someone repeated
laughing

Dont be unkind cried Anna Pvlovna from her end of the table holding
up a threatening finger He is such a worthy and excellent man our
dear Vyazmitinov

Everybody laughed a great deal At the head of the table where the
honored guests sat everyone seemed to be in high spirits and under the
influence of a variety of exciting sensations Only Pierre and Hlne
sat silently side by side almost at the bottom of the table a
suppressed smile brightening both their faces a smile that had nothing
to do with Sergey Kuzmicha smile of bashfulness at their own feelings
But much as all the rest laughed talked and joked much as they
enjoyed their Rhine wine saute and ices and however they avoided
looking at the young couple and heedless and unobservant as they seemed
of them one could feel by the occasional glances they gave that the
story about Sergey Kuzmich the laughter and the food were all a
pretense and that the whole attention of that company was directed
toPierre and Hlne Prince Vasli mimicked the sobbing of Sergey
Kuzmich and at the same time his eyes glanced toward his daughter and
while he laughed the expression on his face clearly said Yes its
getting on it will all be settled today Anna Pvlovna threatened him
on behalf of our dear Vyazmitinov and in her eyes which for an
instant glanced at Pierre Prince Vasli read a congratulation on his
future soninlaw and on his daughters happiness The old princess
sighed sadly as she offered some wine to the old lady next to her and
glanced angrily at her daughter and her sigh seemed to say Yes
theres nothing left for you and me but to sip sweet wine my dear now
that the time has come for these young ones to be thus boldly
provocatively happy And what nonsense all this is that I am saying
thought a diplomatist glancing at the happy faces of the lovers
Thats happiness

Into the insignificant trifling and artificial interests uniting that
society had entered the simple feeling of the attraction of a healthy
and handsome young man and woman for one another And this human feeling
dominated everything else and soared above all their affected chatter
Jests fell flat news was not interesting and the animation was
evidently forced Not only the guests but even the footmen waiting at
table seemed to feel this and they forgot their duties as they looked
at the beautiful Hlne with her radiant face and at the red broad and
happy though uneasy face of Pierre It seemed as if the very light of
the candles was focused on those two happy faces alone

Pierre felt that he was the center of it all and this both pleased and
embarrassed him He was like a man entirely absorbed in some occupation
He did not see hear or understand anything clearly Only now and then
detached ideas and impressions from the world of reality shot
unexpectedly through his mind

So it is all finished he thought And how has it all happened How
quickly Now I know that not because of her alone nor of myself alone
but because of everyone it must inevitably come about They are all
expecting it they are so sure that it will happen that I cannot I
cannot disappoint them But how will it be I do not know but it will
certainly happen thought Pierre glancing at those dazzling shoulders
close to his eyes

Or he would suddenly feel ashamed of he knew not what He felt it
awkward to attract everyones attention and to be considered a lucky man
and with his plain face to be looked on as a sort of Paris possessed
of a Helen But no doubt it always is and must be so he consoled
himself And besides what have I done to bring it about How did it
begin I traveled from Moscow with Prince Vasli Then there was
nothing So why should I not stay at his house Then I played cards with
her and picked up her reticule and drove out with her How did it begin
when did it all come about And here he was sitting by her side as her
betrothed seeing hearing feeling her nearness her breathing her
movements her beauty Then it would suddenly seem to him that it was
not she but he was so unusually beautiful and that that was why they
all looked so at him and flattered by this general admiration he would
expand his chest raise his head and rejoice at his good fortune
Suddenly he heard a familiar voice repeating something to him a second
time But Pierre was so absorbed that he did not understand what was
said

I am asking you when you last heard from Bolknski repeated Prince
Vasli a third time How absentminded you are my dear fellow

Prince Vasli smiled and Pierre noticed that everyone was smiling at
him and Hlne Well what of it if you all know it thought Pierre
What of it Its the truth and he himself smiled his gentle childlike
smile and Hlne smiled too

When did you get the letter Was it from Olmutz repeated Prince
Vasli who pretended to want to know this in order to settle a dispute

How can one talk or think of such trifles thought Pierre

Yes from Olmutz he answered with a sigh

After supper Pierre with his partner followed the others into the
drawing room The guests began to disperse some without taking leave of
Hlne Some as if unwilling to distract her from an important
occupation came up to her for a moment and made haste to go away
refusing to let her see them off The diplomatist preserved a mournful
silence as he left the drawing room He pictured the vanity of his
diplomatic career in comparison with Pierres happiness The old general
grumbled at his wife when she asked how his leg was Oh the old fool
he thought That Princess Hlne will be beautiful still when shes
fifty

I think I may congratulate you whispered Anna Pvlovna to the old
princess kissing her soundly If I hadnt this headache Id have
stayed longer

The old princess did not reply she was tormented by jealousy of her
daughters happiness

While the guests were taking their leave Pierre remained for a long time
alone with Hlne in the little drawing room where they were sitting He
had often before during the last six weeks remained alone with her
but had never spoken to her of love Now he felt that it was inevitable
but he could not make up his mind to take the final step He felt
ashamed he felt that he was occupying someone elses place here beside
Hlne This happiness is not for you some inner voice whispered to
him This happiness is for those who have not in them what there is in
you

But as he had to say something he began by asking her whether she was
satisfied with the party She replied in her usual simple manner that
this name day of hers had been one of the pleasantest she had ever had

Some of the nearest relatives had not yet left They were sitting in the
large drawing room Prince Vasli came up to Pierre with languid
footsteps Pierre rose and said it was getting late Prince Vasli gave
him a look of stern inquiry as though what Pierre had just said was so
strange that one could not take it in But then the expression of
severity changed and he drew Pierres hand downwards made him sit
down and smiled affectionately

Well Lelya he asked turning instantly to his daughter and
addressing her with the careless tone of habitual tenderness natural to
parents who have petted their children from babyhood but which Prince
Vasli had only acquired by imitating other parents

And he again turned to Pierre

Sergey KuzmichFrom all sides he said unbuttoning the top button of
his waistcoat

Pierre smiled but his smile showed that he knew it was not the story
about Sergey Kuzmich that interested Prince Vasli just then and Prince
Vasli saw that Pierre knew this He suddenly muttered something and
went away It seemed to Pierre that even the prince was disconcerted
The sight of the discomposure of that old man of the world touched
Pierre he looked at Hlne and she too seemed disconcerted and her
look seemed to say Well it is your own fault

The step must be taken but I cannot I cannot thought Pierre and he
again began speaking about indifferent matters about Sergey Kuzmich
asking what the point of the story was as he had not heard it properly
Hlne answered with a smile that she too had missed it

When Prince Vasli returned to the drawing room the princess his wife
was talking in low tones to the elderly lady about Pierre

Of course it is a very brilliant match but happiness my dear

Marriages are made in heaven replied the elderly lady

Prince Vasli passed by seeming not to hear the ladies and sat down on
a sofa in a far corner of the room He closed his eyes and seemed to be
dozing His head sank forward and then he roused himself

Aline he said to his wife go and see what they are about

The princess went up to the door passed by it with a dignified and
indifferent air and glanced into the little drawing room Pierre and
Hlne still sat talking just as before

Still the same she said to her husband

Prince Vasli frowned twisting his mouth his cheeks quivered and his
face assumed the coarse unpleasant expression peculiar to him Shaking
himself he rose threw back his head and with resolute steps went past
the ladies into the little drawing room With quick steps he went
joyfully up to Pierre His face was so unusually triumphant that Pierre
rose in alarm on seeing it

Thank God said Prince Vasli My wife has told me everything He
put one arm around Pierre and the other around his daughterMy dear
boy Lelya I am very pleased His voice trembled I loved your
father and she will make you a good wife God bless you

He embraced his daughter and then again Pierre and kissed him with his
malodorous mouth Tears actually moistened his cheeks

Princess come here he shouted

The old princess came in and also wept The elderly lady was using her
handkerchief too Pierre was kissed and he kissed the beautiful
Hlnes hand several times After a while they were left alone again

All this had to be and could not be otherwise thought Pierre so it
is useless to ask whether it is good or bad It is good because its
definite and one is rid of the old tormenting doubt Pierre held the
hand of his betrothed in silence looking at her beautiful bosom as it
rose and fell

Hlne he said aloud and paused

Something special is always said in such cases he thought but could
not remember what it was that people say He looked at her face She
drew nearer to him Her face flushed

Oh take those off those she said pointing to his spectacles

Pierre took them off and his eyes besides the strange look eyes have
from which spectacles have just been removed had also a frightened and
inquiring look He was about to stoop over her hand and kiss it but
with a rapid almost brutal movement of her head she intercepted his
lips and met them with her own Her face struck Pierre by its altered
unpleasantly excited expression

It is too late now its done besides I love her thought Pierre

Je vous aime he said remembering what has to be said at such
moments but his words sounded so weak that he felt ashamed of himself

 I love you

Six weeks later he was married and settled in Count Bezkhovs large
newly furnished Petersburg house the happy possessor as people said
of a wife who was a celebrated beauty and of millions of money





CHAPTER III

Old Prince Nicholas Bolknski received a letter from Prince Vasli in
November 1805 announcing that he and his son would be paying him a
visit I am starting on a journey of inspection and of course I shall
think nothing of an extra seventy miles to come and see you at the same
time my honored benefactor wrote Prince Vasli My son Anatole is
accompanying me on his way to the army so I hope you will allow him
personally to express the deep respect that emulating his father he
feels for you

It seems that there will be no need to bring Mary out suitors are
coming to us of their own accord incautiously remarked the little
princess on hearing the news

Prince Nicholas frowned but said nothing

A fortnight after the letter Prince Vaslis servants came one evening
in advance of him and he and his son arrived next day

Old Bolknski had always had a poor opinion of Prince Vaslis
character but more so recently since in the new reigns of Paul and
Alexander Prince Vasli had risen to high position and honors And now
from the hints contained in his letter and given by the little princess
he saw which way the wind was blowing and his low opinion changed into
a feeling of contemptuous ill will He snorted whenever he mentioned
him On the day of Prince Vaslis arrival Prince Bolknski was
particularly discontented and out of temper Whether he was in a bad
temper because Prince Vasli was coming or whether his being in a bad
temper made him specially annoyed at Prince Vaslis visit he was in a
bad temper and in the morning Tkhon had already advised the architect
not to go to the prince with his report

Do you hear how hes walking said Tkhon drawing the architects
attention to the sound of the princes footsteps Stepping flat on his
heelswe know what that means

However at nine oclock the prince in his velvet coat with a sable
collar and cap went out for his usual walk It had snowed the day
before and the path to the hothouse along which the prince was in the
habit of walking had been swept the marks of the broom were still
visible in the snow and a shovel had been left sticking in one of the
soft snowbanks that bordered both sides of the path The prince went
through the conservatories the serfs quarters and the outbuildings
frowning and silent

Can a sleigh pass he asked his overseer a venerable man resembling
his master in manners and looks who was accompanying him back to the
house

The snow is deep I am having the avenue swept your honor

The prince bowed his head and went up to the porch God be thanked
thought the overseer the storm has blown over

It would have been hard to drive up your honor he added I heard
your honor that a minister is coming to visit your honor

The prince turned round to the overseer and fixed his eyes on him
frowning

What A minister What minister Who gave orders he said in his
shrill harsh voice The road is not swept for the princess my
daughter but for a minister For me there are no ministers

Your honor I thought

You thought shouted the prince his words coming more and more
rapidly and indistinctly You thought Rascals Blackguards Ill
teach you to think and lifting his stick he swung it and would have
hit Alpatych the overseer had not the latter instinctively avoided the
blow Thought Blackguards shouted the prince rapidly

But although Alpatych frightened at his own temerity in avoiding the
stroke came up to the prince bowing his bald head resignedly before
him or perhaps for that very reason the prince though he continued to
shout Blackguards Throw the snow back on the road did not lift
his stick again but hurried into the house

Before dinner Princess Mary and Mademoiselle Bourienne who knew that
the prince was in a bad humor stood awaiting him Mademoiselle
Bourienne with a radiant face that said I know nothing I am the same
as usual and Princess Mary pale frightened and with downcast eyes
What she found hardest to bear was to know that on such occasions she
ought to behave like Mademoiselle Bourienne but could not She thought
If I seem not to notice he will think that I do not sympathize with
him if I seem sad and out of spirits myself he will say as he has
done before that Im in the dumps

The prince looked at his daughters frightened face and snorted

Fool or dummy he muttered

And the other one is not here Theyve been telling tales he
thoughtreferring to the little princess who was not in the dining room

Where is the princess he asked Hiding

She is not very well answered Mademoiselle Bourienne with a bright
smile so she wont come down It is natural in her state

Hm Hm muttered the prince sitting down

His plate seemed to him not quite clean and pointing to a spot he flung
it away Tkhon caught it and handed it to a footman The little
princess was not unwell but had such an overpowering fear of the prince
that hearing he was in a bad humor she had decided not to appear

I am afraid for the baby she said to Mademoiselle Bourienne Heaven
knows what a fright might do

In general at Bald Hills the little princess lived in constant fear and
with a sense of antipathy to the old prince which she did not realize
because the fear was so much the stronger feeling The prince
reciprocated this antipathy but it was overpowered by his contempt for
her When the little princess had grown accustomed to life at Bald
Hills she took a special fancy to Mademoiselle Bourienne spent whole
days with her asked her to sleep in her room and often talked with her
about the old prince and criticized him

So we are to have visitors mon prince remarked Mademoiselle
Bourienne unfolding her white napkin with her rosy fingers His
Excellency Prince Vasli Kurgin and his son I understand she said
inquiringly

Hmhis excellency is a puppy I got him his appointment in the
service said the prince disdainfully Why his son is coming I dont
understand Perhaps Princess Elizabeth and Princess Mary know I dont
want him He looked at his blushing daughter Are you unwell today
Eh Afraid of the minister as that idiot Alpatych called him this
morning

No mon pere

Though Mademoiselle Bourienne had been so unsuccessful in her choice of
a subject she did not stop talking but chattered about the
conservatories and the beauty of a flower that had just opened and
after the soup the prince became more genial

After dinner he went to see his daughterinlaw The little princess
was sitting at a small table chattering with Msha her maid She grew
pale on seeing her fatherinlaw

She was much altered She was now plain rather than pretty Her cheeks
had sunk her lip was drawn up and her eyes drawn down

Yes I feel a kind of oppression she said in reply to the princes
question as to how she felt

Do you want anything

No merci mon pere

Well all right all right

He left the room and went to the waiting room where Alpatych stood with
bowed head

Has the snow been shoveled back

Yes your excellency Forgive me for heavens sake It was only my
stupidity

All right all right interrupted the prince and laughing his
unnatural way he stretched out his hand for Alpatych to kiss and then
proceeded to his study

Prince Vasli arrived that evening He was met in the avenue by coachmen
and footmen who with loud shouts dragged his sleighs up to one of the
lodges over the road purposely laden with snow

Prince Vasli and Anatole had separate rooms assigned to them

Anatole having taken off his overcoat sat with arms akimbo before a
table on a corner of which he smilingly and absentmindedly fixed his
large and handsome eyes He regarded his whole life as a continual round
of amusement which someone for some reason had to provide for him And
he looked on this visit to a churlish old man and a rich and ugly
heiress in the same way All this might he thought turn out very well
and amusingly And why not marry her if she really has so much money
That never does any harm thought Anatole

He shaved and scented himself with the care and elegance which had
become habitual to him and his handsome head held high entered his
fathers room with the goodhumored and victorious air natural to him
Prince Vaslis two valets were busy dressing him and he looked round
with much animation and cheerfully nodded to his son as the latter
entered as if to say Yes thats how I want you to look

I say Father joking apart is she very hideous Anatole asked as if
continuing a conversation the subject of which had often been mentioned
during the journey

Enough What nonsense Above all try to be respectful and cautious
with the old prince

If he starts a row Ill go away said Prince Anatole I cant bear
those old men Eh

Remember for you everything depends on this

In the meantime not only was it known in the maidservants rooms that
the minister and his son had arrived but the appearance of both had
been minutely described Princess Mary was sitting alone in her room
vainly trying to master her agitation

Why did they write why did Lise tell me about it It can never
happen she said looking at herself in the glass How shall I enter
the drawing room Even if I like him I cant now be myself with him
The mere thought of her fathers look filled her with terror The little
princess and Mademoiselle Bourienne had already received from Msha the
ladys maid the necessary report of how handsome the ministers son
was with his rosy cheeks and dark eyebrows and with what difficulty
the father had dragged his legs upstairs while the son had followed him
like an eagle three steps at a time Having received this information
the little princess and Mademoiselle Bourienne whose chattering voices
had reached her from the corridor went into Princess Marys room

You know theyve come Marie said the little princess waddling in
and sinking heavily into an armchair

She was no longer in the loose gown she generally wore in the morning
but had on one of her best dresses Her hair was carefully done and her
face was animated which however did not conceal its sunken and faded
outlines Dressed as she used to be in Petersburg society it was still
more noticeable how much plainer she had become Some unobtrusive touch
had been added to Mademoiselle Bouriennes toilet which rendered her
fresh and pretty face yet more attractive

What Are you going to remain as you are dear princess she began
Theyll be announcing that the gentlemen are in the drawing room and we
shall have to go down and you have not smartened yourself up at all

The little princess got up rang for the maid and hurriedly and merrily
began to devise and carry out a plan of how Princess Mary should be
dressed Princess Marys selfesteem was wounded by the fact that the
arrival of a suitor agitated her and still more so by both her
companions not having the least conception that it could be otherwise
To tell them that she felt ashamed for herself and for them would be to
betray her agitation while to decline their offers to dress her would
prolong their banter and insistence She flushed her beautiful eyes
grew dim red blotches came on her face and it took on the unattractive
martyrlike expression it so often wore as she submitted herself to
Mademoiselle Bourienne and Lise Both these women quite sincerely tried
to make her look pretty She was so plain that neither of them could
think of her as a rival so they began dressing her with perfect
sincerity and with the nave and firm conviction women have that dress
can make a face pretty

No really my dear this dress is not pretty said Lise looking
sideways at Princess Mary from a little distance You have a maroon
dress have it fetched Really You know the fate of your whole life may
be at stake But this one is too light its not becoming

It was not the dress but the face and whole figure of Princess Mary
that was not pretty but neither Mademoiselle Bourienne nor the little
princess felt this they still thought that if a blue ribbon were placed
in the hair the hair combed up and the blue scarf arranged lower on
the best maroon dress and so on all would be well They forgot that
the frightened face and the figure could not be altered and that
however they might change the setting and adornment of that face it
would still remain piteous and plain After two or three changes to
which Princess Mary meekly submitted just as her hair had been arranged
on the top of her head a style that quite altered and spoiled her
looks and she had put on a maroon dress with a paleblue scarf the
little princess walked twice round her now adjusting a fold of the
dress with her little hand now arranging the scarf and looking at her
with her head bent first on one side and then on the other

No it will not do she said decidedly clasping her hands No Mary
really this dress does not suit you I prefer you in your little gray
everyday dress Now please do it for my sake Katie she said to the
maid bring the princess her gray dress and youll see Mademoiselle
Bourienne how I shall arrange it she added smiling with a foretaste
of artistic pleasure

But when Katie brought the required dress Princess Mary remained
sitting motionless before the glass looking at her face and saw in the
mirror her eyes full of tears and her mouth quivering ready to burst
into sobs

Come dear princess said Mademoiselle Bourienne just one more
little effort

The little princess taking the dress from the maid came up to Princess
Mary

Well now well arrange something quite simple and becoming she said

The three voices hers Mademoiselle Bouriennes and Katies who was
laughing at something mingled in a merry sound like the chirping of
birds

No leave me alone said Princess Mary

Her voice sounded so serious and so sad that the chirping of the birds
was silenced at once They looked at the beautiful large thoughtful
eyes full of tears and of thoughts gazing shiningly and imploringly at
them and understood that it was useless and even cruel to insist

At least change your coiffure said the little princess Didnt I
tell you she went on turning reproachfully to Mademoiselle Bourienne
Marys is a face which such a coiffure does not suit in the least Not
in the least Please change it

Leave me alone please leave me alone It is all quite the same to me
answered a voice struggling with tears

Mademoiselle Bourienne and the little princess had to own to themselves
that Princess Mary in this guise looked very plain worse than usual
but it was too late She was looking at them with an expression they
both knew an expression thoughtful and sad This expression in Princess
Mary did not frighten them she never inspired fear in anyone but they
knew that when it appeared on her face she became mute and was not to
be shaken in her determination

You will change it wont you said Lise And as Princess Mary gave no
answer she left the room

Princess Mary was left alone She did not comply with Lises request
she not only left her hair as it was but did not even look in her
glass Letting her arms fall helplessly she sat with downcast eyes and
pondered A husband a man a strong dominant and strangely attractive
being rose in her imagination and carried her into a totally different
happy world of his own She fancied a child her ownsuch as she had
seen the day before in the arms of her nurses daughterat her own
breast the husband standing by and gazing tenderly at her and the
child But no it is impossible I am too ugly she thought

Please come to tea The prince will be out in a moment came the
maids voice at the door

She roused herself and felt appalled at what she had been thinking and
before going down she went into the room where the icons hung and her
eyes fixed on the dark face of a large icon of the Saviour lit by a
lamp she stood before it with folded hands for a few moments A painful
doubt filled her soul Could the joy of love of earthly love for a man
be for her In her thoughts of marriage Princess Mary dreamed of
happiness and of children but her strongest most deeply hidden longing
was for earthly love The more she tried to hide this feeling from
others and even from herself the stronger it grew O God she said
how am I to stifle in my heart these temptations of the devil How am I
to renounce forever these vile fancies so as peacefully to fulfill Thy
will And scarcely had she put that question than God gave her the
answer in her own heart Desire nothing for thyself seek nothing be
not anxious or envious Mans future and thy own fate must remain hidden
from thee but live so that thou mayest be ready for anything If it be
Gods will to prove thee in the duties of marriage be ready to fulfill
His will With this consoling thought but yet with a hope for the
fulfillment of her forbidden earthly longing Princess Mary sighed and
having crossed herself went down thinking neither of her gown and
coiffure nor of how she would go in nor of what she would say What
could all that matter in comparison with the will of God without Whose
care not a hair of mans head can fall





CHAPTER IV

When Princess Mary came down Prince Vasli and his son were already in
the drawing room talking to the little princess and Mademoiselle
Bourienne When she entered with her heavy step treading on her heels
the gentlemen and Mademoiselle Bourienne rose and the little princess
indicating her to the gentlemen said Voila Marie Princess Mary saw
them all and saw them in detail She saw Prince Vaslis face serious
for an instant at the sight of her but immediately smiling again and
the little princess curiously noting the impression Marie produced on
the visitors And she saw Mademoiselle Bourienne with her ribbon and
pretty face and her unusually animated look which was fixed on him but
him she could not see she only saw something large brilliant and
handsome moving toward her as she entered the room Prince Vasli
approached first and she kissed the bold forehead that bent over her
hand and answered his question by saying that on the contrary she
remembered him quite well Then Anatole came up to her She still could
not see him She only felt a soft hand taking hers firmly and she
touched with her lips a white forehead over which was beautiful light
brown hair smelling of pomade When she looked up at him she was struck
by his beauty Anatole stood with his right thumb under a button of his
uniform his chest expanded and his back drawn in slightly swinging one
foot and with his head a little bent looked with beaming face at the
princess without speaking and evidently not thinking about her at all
Anatole was not quickwitted nor ready or eloquent in conversation but
he had the faculty so invaluable in society of composure and
imperturbable selfpossession If a man lacking in selfconfidence
remains dumb on a first introduction and betrays a consciousness of the
impropriety of such silence and an anxiety to find something to say the
effect is bad But Anatole was dumb swung his foot and smilingly
examined the princess hair It was evident that he could be silent in
this way for a very long time If anyone finds this silence
inconvenient let him talk but I dont want to he seemed to say
Besides this in his behavior to women Anatole had a manner which
particularly inspires in them curiosity awe and even lovea
supercilious consciousness of his own superiority It was as if he said
to them I know you I know you but why should I bother about you
Youd be only too glad of course Perhaps he did not really think this
when he met womeneven probably he did not for in general he thought
very littlebut his looks and manner gave that impression The princess
felt this and as if wishing to show him that she did not even dare
expect to interest him she turned to his father The conversation was
general and animated thanks to Princess Lises voice and little downy
lip that lifted over her white teeth She met Prince Vasli with that
playful manner often employed by lively chatty people and consisting in
the assumption that between the person they so address and themselves
there are some semiprivate longestablished jokes and amusing
reminiscences though no such reminiscences really existjust as none
existed in this case Prince Vasli readily adopted her tone and the
little princess also drew Anatole whom she hardly knew into these
amusing recollections of things that had never occurred Mademoiselle
Bourienne also shared them and even Princess Mary felt herself
pleasantly made to share in these merry reminiscences

Here at least we shall have the benefit of your company all to
ourselves dear prince said the little princess of course in French
to Prince Vasli Its not as at Annettes receptions where you
always ran away you remember cette chere Annette

 Anna Pvlovna

Ah but you wont talk politics to me like Annette

And our little tea table

Oh yes

Why is it you were never at Annettes the little princess asked
Anatole Ah I know I know she said with a sly glance your brother
Hippolyte told me about your goings on Oh and she shook her finger at
him I have even heard of your doings in Paris

And didnt Hippolyte tell you asked Prince Vasli turning to his son
and seizing the little princess arm as if she would have run away and
he had just managed to catch her didnt he tell you how he himself was
pining for the dear princess and how she showed him the door Oh she
is a pearl among women Princess he added turning to Princess Mary

When Paris was mentioned Mademoiselle Bourienne for her part seized the
opportunity of joining in the general current of recollections

She took the liberty of inquiring whether it was long since Anatole had
left Paris and how he had liked that city Anatole answered the
Frenchwoman very readily and looking at her with a smile talked to her
about her native land When he saw the pretty little Bourienne Anatole
came to the conclusion that he would not find Bald Hills dull either
Not at all bad he thought examining her not at all bad that
little companion I hope she will bring her along with her when were
married la petite est gentille

 The little one is charming

The old prince dressed leisurely in his study frowning and considering
what he was to do The coming of these visitors annoyed him What are
Prince Vasli and that son of his to me Prince Vasli is a shallow
braggart and his son no doubt is a fine specimen he grumbled to
himself What angered him was that the coming of these visitors revived
in his mind an unsettled question he always tried to stifle one about
which he always deceived himself The question was whether he could ever
bring himself to part from his daughter and give her to a husband The
prince never directly asked himself that question knowing beforehand
that he would have to answer it justly and justice clashed not only
with his feelings but with the very possibility of life Life without
Princess Mary little as he seemed to value her was unthinkable to him
And why should she marry he thought To be unhappy for certain
Theres Lise married to Andrewa better husband one would think could
hardly be found nowadaysbut is she contented with her lot And who
would marry Marie for love Plain and awkward Theyll take her for her
connections and wealth Are there no women living unmarried and even
the happier for it So thought Prince Bolknski while dressing and yet
the question he was always putting off demanded an immediate answer
Prince Vasli had brought his son with the evident intention of
proposing and today or tomorrow he would probably ask for an answer
His birth and position in society were not bad Well Ive nothing
against it the prince said to himself but he must be worthy of her
And that is what we shall see

That is what we shall see That is what we shall see he added aloud

He entered the drawing room with his usual alert step glancing rapidly
round the company He noticed the change in the little princess dress
Mademoiselle Bouriennes ribbon Princess Marys unbecoming coiffure
Mademoiselle Bouriennes and Anatoles smiles and the loneliness of his
daughter amid the general conversation Got herself up like a fool he
thought looking irritably at her She is shameless and he ignores
her

He went straight up to Prince Vasli

Well How dye do How dye do Glad to see you

Friendship laughs at distance began Prince Vasli in his usual rapid
selfconfident familiar tone Here is my second son please love and
befriend him

Prince Bolknski surveyed Anatole

Fine young fellow Fine young fellow he said Well come and kiss
me and he offered his cheek

Anatole kissed the old man and looked at him with curiosity and perfect
composure waiting for a display of the eccentricities his father had
told him to expect

Prince Bolknski sat down in his usual place in the corner of the sofa
and drawing up an armchair for Prince Vasli pointed to it and began
questioning him about political affairs and news He seemed to listen
attentively to what Prince Vasli said but kept glancing at Princess
Mary

And so they are writing from Potsdam already he said repeating
Prince Vaslis last words Then rising he suddenly went up to his
daughter

Is it for visitors youve got yourself up like that eh said he
Fine very fine You have done up your hair in this new way for the
visitors and before the visitors I tell you that in future you are
never to dare to change your way of dress without my consent

It was my fault mon pere interceded the little princess with a
blush

You must do as you please said Prince Bolknski bowing to his
daughterinlaw but she need not make a fool of herself shes plain
enough as it is

And he sat down again paying no more attention to his daughter who was
reduced to tears

On the contrary that coiffure suits the princess very well said
Prince Vasli

Now you young prince whats your name said Prince Bolknski
turning to Anatole come here let us talk and get acquainted

Now the fun begins thought Anatole sitting down with a smile beside
the old prince

Well my dear boy I hear youve been educated abroad not taught to
read and write by the deacon like your father and me Now tell me my
dear boy are you serving in the Horse Guards asked the old man
scrutinizing Anatole closely and intently

No I have been transferred to the line said Anatole hardly able to
restrain his laughter

Ah Thats a good thing So my dear boy you wish to serve the Tsar
and the country It is wartime Such a fine fellow must serve Well are
you off to the front

No Prince our regiment has gone to the front but I am attached
what is it I am attached to Papa said Anatole turning to his father
with a laugh

A splendid soldier splendid What am I attached to Ha ha ha
laughed Prince Bolknski and Anatole laughed still louder Suddenly
Prince Bolknski frowned

You may go he said to Anatole

Anatole returned smiling to the ladies

And so youve had him educated abroad Prince Vasli havent you
said the old prince to Prince Vasli

I have done my best for him and I can assure you the education there
is much better than ours

Yes everything is different nowadays everything is changed The lads
a fine fellow a fine fellow Well come with me now He took Prince
Vaslis arm and led him to his study As soon as they were alone
together Prince Vasli announced his hopes and wishes to the old
prince

Well do you think I shall prevent her that I cant part from her
said the old prince angrily What an idea Im ready for it tomorrow
Only let me tell you I want to know my soninlaw better You know my
principleseverything aboveboard I will ask her tomorrow in your
presence if she is willing then he can stay on He can stay and Ill
see The old prince snorted Let her marry its all the same to me
he screamed in the same piercing tone as when parting from his son

I will tell you frankly said Prince Vasli in the tone of a crafty
man convinced of the futility of being cunning with so keensighted a
companion You know you see right through people Anatole is no
genius but he is an honest goodhearted lad an excellent son or
kinsman

All right all right well see

As always happens when women lead lonely lives for any length of time
without male society on Anatoles appearance all the three women of
Prince Bolknskis household felt that their life had not been real till
then Their powers of reasoning feeling and observing immediately
increased tenfold and their life which seemed to have been passed in
darkness was suddenly lit up by a new brightness full of significance

Princess Mary grew quite unconscious of her face and coiffure The
handsome open face of the man who might perhaps be her husband absorbed
all her attention He seemed to her kind brave determined manly and
magnanimous She felt convinced of that Thousands of dreams of a future
family life continually rose in her imagination She drove them away and
tried to conceal them

But am I not too cold with him thought the princess I try to be
reserved because in the depth of my soul I feel too near to him already
but then he cannot know what I think of him and may imagine that I do
not like him

And Princess Mary tried but could not manage to be cordial to her new
guest Poor girl shes devilish ugly thought Anatole

Mademoiselle Bourienne also roused to great excitement by Anatoles
arrival thought in another way Of course she a handsome young woman
without any definite position without relations or even a country did
not intend to devote her life to serving Prince Bolknski to reading
aloud to him and being friends with Princess Mary Mademoiselle
Bourienne had long been waiting for a Russian prince who able to
appreciate at a glance her superiority to the plain badly dressed
ungainly Russian princesses would fall in love with her and carry her
off and here at last was a Russian prince Mademoiselle Bourienne knew
a story heard from her aunt but finished in her own way which she
liked to repeat to herself It was the story of a girl who had been
seduced and to whom her poor mother sa pauvre mere appeared and
reproached her for yielding to a man without being married Mademoiselle
Bourienne was often touched to tears as in imagination she told this
story to him her seducer And now he a real Russian prince had
appeared He would carry her away and then sa pauvre mere would appear
and he would marry her So her future shaped itself in Mademoiselle
Bouriennes head at the very time she was talking to Anatole about
Paris It was not calculation that guided her she did not even for a
moment consider what she should do but all this had long been familiar
to her and now that Anatole had appeared it just grouped itself around
him and she wished and tried to please him as much as possible

The little princess like an old war horse that hears the trumpet
unconsciously and quite forgetting her condition prepared for the
familiar gallop of coquetry without any ulterior motive or any
struggle but with nave and lighthearted gaiety

Although in female society Anatole usually assumed the role of a man
tired of being run after by women his vanity was flattered by the
spectacle of his power over these three women Besides that he was
beginning to feel for the pretty and provocative Mademoiselle Bourienne
that passionate animal feeling which was apt to master him with great
suddenness and prompt him to the coarsest and most reckless actions

After tea the company went into the sitting room and Princess Mary was
asked to play on the clavichord Anatole laughing and in high spirits
came and leaned on his elbows facing her and beside Mademoiselle
Bourienne Princess Mary felt his look with a painfully joyous emotion
Her favorite sonata bore her into a most intimately poetic world and the
look she felt upon her made that world still more poetic But Anatoles
expression though his eyes were fixed on her referred not to her but
to the movements of Mademoiselle Bouriennes little foot which he was
then touching with his own under the clavichord Mademoiselle Bourienne
was also looking at Princess Mary and in her lovely eyes there was a
look of fearful joy and hope that was also new to the princess

How she loves me thought Princess Mary How happy I am now and how
happy I may be with such a friend and such a husband Husband Can it be
possible she thought not daring to look at his face but still
feeling his eyes gazing at her

In the evening after supper when all were about to retire Anatole
kissed Princess Marys hand She did not know how she found the courage
but she looked straight into his handsome face as it came near to her
shortsighted eyes Turning from Princess Mary he went up and kissed
Mademoiselle Bouriennes hand This was not etiquette but then he did
everything so simply and with such assurance Mademoiselle Bourienne
flushed and gave the princess a frightened look

What delicacy thought the princess Is it possible that Amelie
Mademoiselle Bourienne thinks I could be jealous of her and not
value her pure affection and devotion to me She went up to her and
kissed her warmly Anatole went up to kiss the little princess hand

No No No When your father writes to tell me that you are behaving
well I will give you my hand to kiss Not till then she said And
smilingly raising a finger at him she left the room





CHAPTER V

They all separated but except Anatole who fell asleep as soon as he
got into bed all kept awake a long time that night

Is he really to be my husband this stranger who is so kindyes kind
that is the chief thing thought Princess Mary and fear which she had
seldom experienced came upon her She feared to look round it seemed
to her that someone was there standing behind the screen in the dark
corner And this someone was hethe deviland he was also this man with
the white forehead black eyebrows and red lips

She rang for her maid and asked her to sleep in her room

Mademoiselle Bourienne walked up and down the conservatory for a long
time that evening vainly expecting someone now smiling at someone now
working herself up to tears with the imaginary words of her pauvre mere
rebuking her for her fall

The little princess grumbled to her maid that her bed was badly made
She could not lie either on her face or on her side Every position was
awkward and uncomfortable and her burden oppressed her now more than
ever because Anatoles presence had vividly recalled to her the time
when she was not like that and when everything was light and gay She
sat in an armchair in her dressing jacket and nightcap and Katie sleepy
and disheveled beat and turned the heavy feather bed for the third
time muttering to herself

I told you it was all lumps and holes the little princess repeated
I should be glad enough to fall asleep so its not my fault and her
voice quivered like that of a child about to cry

The old prince did not sleep either Tkhon half asleep heard him
pacing angrily about and snorting The old prince felt as though he had
been insulted through his daughter The insult was the more pointed
because it concerned not himself but another his daughter whom he
loved more than himself He kept telling himself that he would consider
the whole matter and decide what was right and how he should act but
instead of that he only excited himself more and more

The first man that turns upshe forgets her father and everything else
runs upstairs and does up her hair and wags her tail and is unlike
herself Glad to throw her father over And she knew I should notice it
Fr fr fr And dont I see that that idiot had eyes only for
BourienneI shall have to get rid of her And how is it she has not
pride enough to see it If she has no pride for herself she might at
least have some for my sake She must be shown that the blockhead thinks
nothing of her and looks only at Bourienne No she has no pride but
Ill let her see

The old prince knew that if he told his daughter she was making a
mistake and that Anatole meant to flirt with Mademoiselle Bourienne
Princess Marys selfesteem would be wounded and his point not to be
parted from her would be gained so pacifying himself with this
thought he called Tkhon and began to undress

What devil brought them here thought he while Tkhon was putting the
nightshirt over his driedup old body and grayhaired chest I never
invited them They came to disturb my lifeand there is not much of it
left

Devil take em he muttered while his head was still covered by the
shirt

Tkhon knew his masters habit of sometimes thinking aloud and
therefore met with unaltered looks the angrily inquisitive expression of
the face that emerged from the shirt

Gone to bed asked the prince

Tkhon like all good valets instinctively knew the direction of his
masters thoughts He guessed that the question referred to Prince
Vasli and his son

They have gone to bed and put out their lights your excellency

No good no good said the prince rapidly and thrusting his feet
into his slippers and his arms into the sleeves of his dressing gown he
went to the couch on which he slept

Though no words had passed between Anatole and Mademoiselle Bourienne
they quite understood one another as to the first part of their romance
up to the appearance of the pauvre mere they understood that they had
much to say to one another in private and so they had been seeking an
opportunity since morning to meet one another alone When Princess Mary
went to her fathers room at the usual hour Mademoiselle Bourienne and
Anatole met in the conservatory

Princess Mary went to the door of the study with special trepidation It
seemed to her that not only did everybody know that her fate would be
decided that day but that they also knew what she thought about it She
read this in Tkhons face and in that of Prince Vaslis valet who
made her a low bow when she met him in the corridor carrying hot water

The old prince was very affectionate and careful in his treatment of his
daughter that morning Princess Mary well knew this painstaking
expression of her fathers His face wore that expression when his dry
hands clenched with vexation at her not understanding a sum in
arithmetic when rising from his chair he would walk away from her
repeating in a low voice the same words several times over

He came to the point at once treating her ceremoniously

I have had a proposition made me concerning you he said with an
unnatural smile I expect you have guessed that Prince Vasli has not
come and brought his pupil with him for some reason Prince Bolknski
referred to Anatole as a pupil for the sake of my beautiful eyes
Last night a proposition was made me on your account and as you know my
principles I refer it to you

How am I to understand you mon pere said the princess growing pale
and then blushing

How understand me cried her father angrily Prince Vasli finds you
to his taste as a daughterinlaw and makes a proposal to you on his
pupils behalf Thats how its to be understood How understand
it And I ask you

I do not know what you think Father whispered the princess

I I What of me Leave me out of the question Im not going to get
married What about you Thats what I want to know

The princess saw that her father regarded the matter with disapproval
but at that moment the thought occurred to her that her fate would be
decided now or never She lowered her eyes so as not to see the gaze
under which she felt that she could not think but would only be able to
submit from habit and she said I wish only to do your will but if I
had to express my own desire She had no time to finish The old
prince interrupted her

Thats admirable he shouted He will take you with your dowry and
take Mademoiselle Bourienne into the bargain Shell be the wife while
you

The prince stopped He saw the effect these words had produced on his
daughter She lowered her head and was ready to burst into tears

Now then now then Im only joking he said Remember this
Princess I hold to the principle that a maiden has a full right to
choose I give you freedom Only remember that your lifes happiness
depends on your decision Never mind me

But I do not know Father

Theres no need to talk He receives his orders and will marry you or
anybody but you are free to choose Go to your room think it over
and come back in an hour and tell me in his presence yes or no I know
you will pray over it Well pray if you like but you had better think
it over Go Yes or no yes or no yes or no he still shouted when the
princess as if lost in a fog had already staggered out of the study

Her fate was decided and happily decided But what her father had said
about Mademoiselle Bourienne was dreadful It was untrue to be sure but
still it was terrible and she could not help thinking of it She was
going straight on through the conservatory neither seeing nor hearing
anything when suddenly the wellknown whispering of Mademoiselle
Bourienne aroused her She raised her eyes and two steps away saw
Anatole embracing the Frenchwoman and whispering something to her With
a horrified expression on his handsome face Anatole looked at Princess
Mary but did not at once take his arm from the waist of Mademoiselle
Bourienne who had not yet seen her

Whos that Why Wait a moment Anatoles face seemed to say Princess
Mary looked at them in silence She could not understand it At last
Mademoiselle Bourienne gave a scream and ran away Anatole bowed to
Princess Mary with a gay smile as if inviting her to join in a laugh at
this strange incident and then shrugging his shoulders went to the door
that led to his own apartments

An hour later Tkhon came to call Princess Mary to the old prince he
added that Prince Vasli was also there When Tkhon came to her
Princess Mary was sitting on the sofa in her room holding the weeping
Mademoiselle Bourienne in her arms and gently stroking her hair The
princess beautiful eyes with all their former calm radiance were
looking with tender affection and pity at Mademoiselle Bouriennes
pretty face

No Princess I have lost your affection forever said Mademoiselle
Bourienne

Why I love you more than ever said Princess Mary and I will try to
do all I can for your happiness

But you despise me You who are so pure can never understand being so
carried away by passion Oh only my poor mother

I quite understand answered Princess Mary with a sad smile Calm
yourself my dear I will go to my father she said and went out

Prince Vasli with one leg thrown high over the other and a snuffbox in
his hand was sitting there with a smile of deep emotion on his face as
if stirred to his hearts core and himself regretting and laughing at
his own sensibility when Princess Mary entered He hurriedly took a
pinch of snuff

Ah my dear my dear he began rising and taking her by both hands
Then sighing he added My sons fate is in your hands Decide my
dear good gentle Marie whom I have always loved as a daughter

He drew back and a real tear appeared in his eye

Fr fr snorted Prince Bolknski The prince is making a
proposition to you in his pupilsI mean his sonsname Do you wish or
not to be Prince Anatole Kurgins wife Reply yes or no he shouted
and then I shall reserve the right to state my opinion also Yes my
opinion and only my opinion added Prince Bolknski turning to Prince
Vasli and answering his imploring look Yes or no

My desire is never to leave you Father never to separate my life from
yours I dont wish to marry she answered positively glancing at
Prince Vasli and at her father with her beautiful eyes

Humbug Nonsense Humbug humbug humbug cried Prince Bolknski
frowning and taking his daughters hand he did not kiss her but only
bending his forehead to hers just touched it and pressed her hand so
that she winced and uttered a cry

Prince Vasli rose

My dear I must tell you that this is a moment I shall never never
forget But my dear will you not give us a little hope of touching
this heart so kind and generous Say perhaps The future is so
long Say perhaps

Prince what I have said is all there is in my heart I thank you for
the honor but I shall never be your sons wife

Well so thats finished my dear fellow I am very glad to have seen
you Very glad Go back to your rooms Princess Go said the old
prince Very very glad to have seen you repeated he embracing
Prince Vasli

My vocation is a different one thought Princess Mary My vocation is
to be happy with another kind of happiness the happiness of love and
selfsacrifice And cost what it may I will arrange poor Amelies
happiness she loves him so passionately and so passionately repents I
will do all I can to arrange the match between them If he is not rich I
will give her the means I will ask my father and Andrew I shall be so
happy when she is his wife She is so unfortunate a stranger alone
helpless And oh God how passionately she must love him if she could
so far forget herself Perhaps I might have done the same thought
Princess Mary





CHAPTER VI

It was long since the Rostvs had news of Nicholas Not till midwinter
was the count at last handed a letter addressed in his sons
handwriting On receiving it he ran on tiptoe to his study in alarm and
haste trying to escape notice closed the door and began to read the
letter

Anna Mikhylovna who always knew everything that passed in the house
on hearing of the arrival of the letter went softly into the room and
found the count with it in his hand sobbing and laughing at the same
time

Anna Mikhylovna though her circumstances had improved was still
living with the Rostvs

My dear friend said she in a tone of pathetic inquiry prepared to
sympathize in any way

The count sobbed yet more

Nikolenka a letter wa a s wounded my darling boy
the countess promoted to be an officer thank God How tell the
little countess

Anna Mikhylovna sat down beside him with her own handkerchief wiped
the tears from his eyes and from the letter then having dried her own
eyes she comforted the count and decided that at dinner and till
teatime she would prepare the countess and after tea with Gods help
would inform her

At dinner Anna Mikhylovna talked the whole time about the war news and
about Nikolenka twice asked when the last letter had been received from
him though she knew that already and remarked that they might very
likely be getting a letter from him that day Each time that these hints
began to make the countess anxious and she glanced uneasily at the count
and at Anna Mikhylovna the latter very adroitly turned the
conversation to insignificant matters Natsha who of the whole
family was the most gifted with a capacity to feel any shades of
intonation look and expression pricked up her ears from the beginning
of the meal and was certain that there was some secret between her
father and Anna Mikhylovna that it had something to do with her
brother and that Anna Mikhylovna was preparing them for it Bold as
she was Natsha who knew how sensitive her mother was to anything
relating to Nikolenka did not venture to ask any questions at dinner
but she was too excited to eat anything and kept wriggling about on her
chair regardless of her governess remarks After dinner she rushed
head long after Anna Mikhylovna and dashing at her flung herself on
her neck as soon as she overtook her in the sitting room

Auntie darling do tell me what it is

Nothing my dear

No dearest sweet one honey I wont give upI know you know
something

Anna Mikhylovna shook her head

You are a little slyboots she said

A letter from Nikolenka Im sure of it exclaimed Natsha reading
confirmation in Anna Mikhylovnas face

But for Gods sake be careful you know how it may affect your mamma

I will I will only tell me You wont Then I will go and tell at
once

Anna Mikhylovna in a few words told her the contents of the letter
on condition that she should tell no one

No on my true word of honor said Natsha crossing herself I wont
tell anyone and she ran off at once to Snya

Nikolenka wounded a letter she announced in gleeful triumph

Nicholas was all Snya said instantly turning white

Natsha seeing the impression the news of her brothers wound produced
on Snya felt for the first time the sorrowful side of the news

She rushed to Snya hugged her and began to cry

A little wound but he has been made an officer he is well now he
wrote himself said she through her tears

There now Its true that all you women are crybabies remarked Ptya
pacing the room with large resolute strides Now Im very glad very
glad indeed that my brother has distinguished himself so You are all
blubberers and understand nothing

Natsha smiled through her tears

You havent read the letter asked Snya

No but she said that it was all over and that hes now an officer

Thank God said Snya crossing herself But perhaps she deceived
you Let us go to Mamma

Ptya paced the room in silence for a time

If Id been in Nikolenkas place I would have killed even more of those
Frenchmen he said What nasty brutes they are Id have killed so
many that thered have been a heap of them

Hold your tongue Ptya what a goose you are

Im not a goose but they are who cry about trifles said Ptya

Do you remember him Natsha suddenly asked after a moments silence

Snya smiled

Do I remember Nicholas

No Snya but do you remember so that you remember him perfectly
remember everything said Natsha with an expressive gesture
evidently wishing to give her words a very definite meaning I remember
Nikolenka too I remember him well she said But I dont remember
Bors I dont remember him a bit

What You dont remember Bors asked Snya in surprise

Its not that I dont rememberI know what he is like but not as I
remember Nikolenka HimI just shut my eyes and remember but Bors
No She shut her eyes No theres nothing at all

Oh Natsha said Snya looking ecstatically and earnestly at her
friend as if she did not consider her worthy to hear what she meant to
say and as if she were saying it to someone else with whom joking was
out of the question I am in love with your brother once for all and
whatever may happen to him or to me shall never cease to love him as
long as I live

Natsha looked at Snya with wondering and inquisitive eyes and said
nothing She felt that Snya was speaking the truth that there was such
love as Snya was speaking of But Natsha had not yet felt anything
like it She believed it could be but did not understand it

Shall you write to him she asked

Snya became thoughtful The question of how to write to Nicholas and
whether she ought to write tormented her Now that he was already an
officer and a wounded hero would it be right to remind him of herself
and as it might seem of the obligations to her he had taken on
himself

I dont know I think if he writes I will write too she said
blushing

And you wont feel ashamed to write to him

Snya smiled

No

And I should be ashamed to write to Bors Im not going to

Why should you be ashamed

Well I dont know Its awkward and would make me ashamed

And I know why shed be ashamed said Ptya offended by Natshas
previous remark Its because she was in love with that fat one in
spectacles that was how Ptya described his namesake the new Count
Bezkhov and now shes in love with that singer he meant Natshas
Italian singing master thats why shes ashamed

Ptya youre a stupid said Natsha

Not more stupid than you madam said the nineyearold Ptya with
the air of an old brigadier

The countess had been prepared by Anna Mikhylovnas hints at dinner On
retiring to her own room she sat in an armchair her eyes fixed on a
miniature portrait of her son on the lid of a snuffbox while the tears
kept coming into her eyes Anna Mikhylovna with the letter came on
tiptoe to the countess door and paused

Dont come in she said to the old count who was following her Come
later And she went in closing the door behind her

The count put his ear to the keyhole and listened

At first he heard the sound of indifferent voices then Anna
Mikhylovnas voice alone in a long speech then a cry then silence
then both voices together with glad intonations and then footsteps
Anna Mikhylovna opened the door Her face wore the proud expression of
a surgeon who has just performed a difficult operation and admits the
public to appreciate his skill

It is done she said to the count pointing triumphantly to the
countess who sat holding in one hand the snuffbox with its portrait and
in the other the letter and pressing them alternately to her lips

When she saw the count she stretched out her arms to him embraced his
bald head over which she again looked at the letter and the portrait
and in order to press them again to her lips she slightly pushed away
the bald head Vra Natsha Snya and Ptya now entered the room and
the reading of the letter began After a brief description of the
campaign and the two battles in which he had taken part and his
promotion Nicholas said that he kissed his fathers and mothers hands
asking for their blessing and that he kissed Vra Natsha and Ptya
Besides that he sent greetings to Monsieur Schelling Madame Schoss
and his old nurse and asked them to kiss for him dear Snya whom he
loved and thought of just the same as ever When she heard this Snya
blushed so that tears came into her eyes and unable to bear the looks
turned upon her ran away into the dancing hall whirled round it at
full speed with her dress puffed out like a balloon and flushed and
smiling plumped down on the floor The countess was crying

Why are you crying Mamma asked Vra From all he says one should be
glad and not cry

This was quite true but the count the countess and Natsha looked at
her reproachfully And who is it she takes after thought the
countess

Nicholas letter was read over hundreds of times and those who were
considered worthy to hear it had to come to the countess for she did
not let it out of her hands The tutors came and the nurses and
Dmtri and several acquaintances and the countess reread the letter
each time with fresh pleasure and each time discovered in it fresh
proofs of Nikolenkas virtues How strange how extraordinary how
joyful it seemed that her son the scarcely perceptible motion of whose
tiny limbs she had felt twenty years ago within her that son about whom
she used to have quarrels with the too indulgent count that son who had
first learned to say pear and then granny that this son should now
be away in a foreign land amid strange surroundings a manly warrior
doing some kind of mans work of his own without help or guidance The
universal experience of ages showing that children do grow
imperceptibly from the cradle to manhood did not exist for the
countess Her sons growth toward manhood at each of its stages had
seemed as extraordinary to her as if there had never existed the
millions of human beings who grew up in the same way As twenty years
before it seemed impossible that the little creature who lived
somewhere under her heart would ever cry suck her breast and begin to
speak so now she could not believe that that little creature could be
this strong brave man this model son and officer that judging by this
letter he now was

What a style How charmingly he describes said she reading the
descriptive part of the letter And what a soul Not a word about
himself Not a word About some Denisov or other though he himself
I dare say is braver than any of them He says nothing about his
sufferings What a heart How like him it is And how he has remembered
everybody Not forgetting anyone I always said when he was only so
highI always said

For more than a week preparations were being made rough drafts of
letters to Nicholas from all the household were written and copied out
while under the supervision of the countess and the solicitude of the
count money and all things necessary for the uniform and equipment of
the newly commissioned officer were collected Anna Mikhylovna
practical woman that she was had even managed by favor with army
authorities to secure advantageous means of communication for herself
and her son She had opportunities of sending her letters to the Grand
Duke Constantine Pavlovich who commanded the Guards The Rostvs
supposed that The Russian Guards Abroad was quite a definite address
and that if a letter reached the Grand Duke in command of the Guards
there was no reason why it should not reach the Pvlograd regiment
which was presumably somewhere in the same neighborhood And so it was
decided to send the letters and money by the Grand Dukes courier to
Bors and Bors was to forward them to Nicholas The letters were from
the old count the countess Ptya Vra Natsha and Snya and
finally there were six thousand rubles for his outfit and various other
things the old count sent to his son





CHAPTER VII

On the twelfth of November Kutzovs active army in camp before
Olmutz was preparing to be reviewed next day by the two Emperorsthe
Russian and the Austrian The Guards just arrived from Russia spent
the night ten miles from Olmutz and next morning were to come straight
to the review reaching the field at Olmutz by ten oclock

That day Nicholas Rostv received a letter from Bors telling him that
the Ismaylov regiment was quartered for the night ten miles from Olmutz
and that he wanted to see him as he had a letter and money for him
Rostv was particularly in need of money now that the troops after
their active service were stationed near Olmutz and the camp swarmed
with wellprovisioned sutlers and Austrian Jews offering all sorts of
tempting wares The Pvlograds held feast after feast celebrating
awards they had received for the campaign and made expeditions to
Olmutz to visit a certain Caroline the Hungarian who had recently
opened a restaurant there with girls as waitresses Rostv who had just
celebrated his promotion to a cornetcy and bought Denisovs horse
Bedouin was in debt all round to his comrades and the sutlers On
receiving Bors letter he rode with a fellow officer to Olmutz dined
there drank a bottle of wine and then set off alone to the Guards
camp to find his old playmate Rostv had not yet had time to get his
uniform He had on a shabby cadet jacket decorated with a soldiers
cross equally shabby cadets riding breeches lined with worn leather
and an officers saber with a sword knot The Don horse he was riding
was one he had bought from a Cossack during the campaign and he wore a
crumpled hussar cap stuck jauntily back on one side of his head As he
rode up to the camp he thought how he would impress Bors and all his
comrades of the Guards by his appearancethat of a fighting hussar who
had been under fire

The Guards had made their whole march as if on a pleasure trip parading
their cleanliness and discipline They had come by easy stages their
knapsacks conveyed on carts and the Austrian authorities had provided
excellent dinners for the officers at every halting place The regiments
had entered and left the town with their bands playing and by the Grand
Dukes orders the men had marched all the way in step a practice on
which the Guards prided themselves the officers on foot and at their
proper posts Bors had been quartered and had marched all the way
with Berg who was already in command of a company Berg who had
obtained his captaincy during the campaign had gained the confidence of
his superiors by his promptitude and accuracy and had arranged his money
matters very satisfactorily Bors during the campaign had made the
acquaintance of many persons who might prove useful to him and by a
letter of recommendation he had brought from Pierre had become
acquainted with Prince Andrew Bolknski through whom he hoped to obtain
a post on the commanderinchiefs staff Berg and Bors having rested
after yesterdays march were sitting clean and neatly dressed at a
round table in the clean quarters allotted to them playing chess Berg
held a smoking pipe between his knees Bors in the accurate way
characteristic of him was building a little pyramid of chessmen with
his delicate white fingers while awaiting Bergs move and watched his
opponents face evidently thinking about the game as he always thought
only of whatever he was engaged on

Well how are you going to get out of that he remarked

Well try to replied Berg touching a pawn and then removing his
hand

At that moment the door opened

Here he is at last shouted Rostv And Berg too Oh you
petisenfans allay cushay dormir he exclaimed imitating his Russian
nurses French at which he and Bors used to laugh long ago

Dear me how you have changed

Bors rose to meet Rostv but in doing so did not omit to steady and
replace some chessmen that were falling He was about to embrace his
friend but Nicholas avoided him With that peculiar feeling of youth
that dread of beaten tracks and wish to express itself in a manner
different from that of its elders which is often insincere Nicholas
wished to do something special on meeting his friend He wanted to pinch
him push him do anything but kiss hima thing everybody did But
notwithstanding this Bors embraced him in a quiet friendly way and
kissed him three times

They had not met for nearly half a year and being at the age when young
men take their first steps on lifes road each saw immense changes in
the other quite a new reflection of the society in which they had taken
those first steps Both had changed greatly since they last met and both
were in a hurry to show the changes that had taken place in them

Oh you damned dandies Clean and fresh as if youd been to a fete not
like us sinners of the line cried Rostv with martial swagger and
with baritone notes in his voice new to Bors pointing to his own mud
bespattered breeches The German landlady hearing Rostvs loud voice
popped her head in at the door

Eh is she pretty he asked with a wink

Why do you shout so Youll frighten them said Bors I did not
expect you today he added I only sent you the note yesterday by
Bolknskian adjutant of Kutzovs whos a friend of mine I did not
think he would get it to you so quickly Well how are you Been
under fire already asked Bors

Without answering Rostv shook the soldiers Cross of St George
fastened to the cording of his uniform and indicating a bandaged arm
glanced at Berg with a smile

As you see he said

Indeed Yes yes said Bors with a smile And we too have had a
splendid march You know of course that His Imperial Highness rode
with our regiment all the time so that we had every comfort and every
advantage What receptions we had in Poland What dinners and balls I
cant tell you And the Tsarevich was very gracious to all our
officers

And the two friends told each other of their doings the one of his
hussar revels and life in the fighting line the other of the pleasures
and advantages of service under members of the Imperial family

Oh you Guards said Rostv I say send for some wine

Bors made a grimace

If you really want it said he

He went to his bed drew a purse from under the clean pillow and sent
for wine

Yes and I have some money and a letter to give you he added

Rostv took the letter and throwing the money on the sofa put both
arms on the table and began to read After reading a few lines he
glanced angrily at Berg then meeting his eyes hid his face behind the
letter

Well theyve sent you a tidy sum said Berg eying the heavy purse
that sank into the sofa As for us Count we get along on our pay I
can tell you for myself

I say Berg my dear fellow said Rostv when you get a letter from
home and meet one of your own people whom you want to talk everything
over with and I happen to be there Ill go at once to be out of your
way Do go somewhere anywhere to the devil he exclaimed and
immediately seizing him by the shoulder and looking amiably into his
face evidently wishing to soften the rudeness of his words he added
Dont be hurt my dear fellow you know I speak from my heart as to an
old acquaintance

Oh dont mention it Count I quite understand said Berg getting up
and speaking in a muffled and guttural voice

Go across to our hosts they invited you added Bors

Berg put on the cleanest of coats without a spot or speck of dust
stood before a looking glass and brushed the hair on his temples
upwards in the way affected by the Emperor Alexander and having
assured himself from the way Rostv looked at it that his coat had been
noticed left the room with a pleasant smile

Oh dear what a beast I am muttered Rostv as he read the letter

Why

Oh what a pig I am not to have written and to have given them such a
fright Oh what a pig I am he repeated flushing suddenly Well
have you sent Gabriel for some wine All right lets have some

In the letter from his parents was enclosed a letter of recommendation
to Bagration which the old countess at Anna Mikhylovnas advice had
obtained through an acquaintance and sent to her son asking him to take
it to its destination and make use of it

What nonsense Much I need it said Rostv throwing the letter under
the table

Why have you thrown that away asked Bors

It is some letter of recommendation what the devil do I want it
for

Why What the devil said Bors picking it up and reading the
address This letter would be of great use to you

I want nothing and I wont be anyones adjutant

Why not inquired Bors

Its a lackeys job

You are still the same dreamer I see remarked Bors shaking his
head

And youre still the same diplomatist But thats not the point
Come how are you asked Rostv

Well as you see So far everythings all right but I confess I should
much like to be an adjutant and not remain at the front

Why

Because when once a man starts on military service he should try to
make as successful a career of it as possible

Oh thats it said Rostv evidently thinking of something else

He looked intently and inquiringly into his friends eyes evidently
trying in vain to find the answer to some question

Old Gabriel brought in the wine

Shouldnt we now send for Berg asked Bors He would drink with you
I cant

Well send for him and how do you get on with that German asked
Rostv with a contemptuous smile

He is a very very nice honest and pleasant fellow answered Bors

Again Rostv looked intently into Bors eyes and sighed Berg returned
and over the bottle of wine conversation between the three officers
became animated The Guardsmen told Rostv of their march and how they
had been made much of in Russia Poland and abroad They spoke of the
sayings and doings of their commander the Grand Duke and told stories
of his kindness and irascibility Berg as usual kept silent when the
subject did not relate to himself but in connection with the stories of
the Grand Dukes quick temper he related with gusto how in Galicia he
had managed to deal with the Grand Duke when the latter made a tour of
the regiments and was annoyed at the irregularity of a movement With a
pleasant smile Berg related how the Grand Duke had ridden up to him in a
violent passion shouting Arnauts Arnauts was the Tsarevichs
favorite expression when he was in a rage and called for the company
commander

Would you believe it Count I was not at all alarmed because I knew I
was right Without boasting you know I may say that I know the Army
Orders by heart and know the Regulations as well as I do the Lords
Prayer So Count there never is any negligence in my company and so
my conscience was at ease I came forward Berg stood up and showed
how he presented himself with his hand to his cap and really it would
have been difficult for a face to express greater respect and self
complacency than his did Well he stormed at me as the saying is
stormed and stormed and stormed It was not a matter of life but rather
of death as the saying is Albanians and devils and To
Siberia said Berg with a sagacious smile I knew I was in the right
so I kept silent was not that best Count Hey are you dumb he
shouted Still I remained silent And what do you think Count The next
day it was not even mentioned in the Orders of the Day Thats what
keeping ones head means Thats the way Count said Berg lighting
his pipe and emitting rings of smoke

Yes that was fine said Rostv smiling

But Bors noticed that he was preparing to make fun of Berg and
skillfully changed the subject He asked him to tell them how and where
he got his wound This pleased Rostv and he began talking about it and
as he went on became more and more animated He told them of his Schon
Grabern affair just as those who have taken part in a battle generally
do describe it that is as they would like it to have been as they
have heard it described by others and as sounds well but not at all as
it really was Rostv was a truthful young man and would on no account
have told a deliberate lie He began his story meaning to tell
everything just as it happened but imperceptibly involuntarily and
inevitably he lapsed into falsehood If he had told the truth to his
hearerswho like himself had often heard stories of attacks and had
formed a definite idea of what an attack was and were expecting to hear
just such a storythey would either not have believed him or still
worse would have thought that Rostv was himself to blame since what
generally happens to the narrators of cavalry attacks had not happened
to him He could not tell them simply that everyone went at a trot and
that he fell off his horse and sprained his arm and then ran as hard as
he could from a Frenchman into the wood Besides to tell everything as
it really happened it would have been necessary to make an effort of
will to tell only what happened It is very difficult to tell the truth
and young people are rarely capable of it His hearers expected a story
of how beside himself and all aflame with excitement he had flown like
a storm at the square cut his way in slashed right and left how his
saber had tasted flesh and he had fallen exhausted and so on And so he
told them all that

In the middle of his story just as he was saying You cannot imagine
what a strange frenzy one experiences during an attack Prince Andrew
whom Bors was expecting entered the room Prince Andrew who liked to
help young men was flattered by being asked for his assistance and
being well disposed toward Bors who had managed to please him the day
before he wished to do what the young man wanted Having been sent with
papers from Kutzov to the Tsarevich he looked in on Bors hoping to
find him alone When he came in and saw an hussar of the line recounting
his military exploits Prince Andrew could not endure that sort of man
he gave Bors a pleasant smile frowned as with halfclosed eyes he
looked at Rostv bowed slightly and wearily and sat down languidly on
the sofa he felt it unpleasant to have dropped in on bad company
Rostv flushed up on noticing this but he did not care this was a mere
stranger Glancing however at Bors he saw that he too seemed ashamed
of the hussar of the line

In spite of Prince Andrews disagreeable ironical tone in spite of the
contempt with which Rostv from his fighting army point of view
regarded all these little adjutants on the staff of whom the newcomer
was evidently one Rostv felt confused blushed and became silent
Bors inquired what news there might be on the staff and what without
indiscretion one might ask about our plans

We shall probably advance replied Bolknski evidently reluctant to
say more in the presence of a stranger

Berg took the opportunity to ask with great politeness whether as was
rumored the allowance of forage money to captains of companies would be
doubled To this Prince Andrew answered with a smile that he could give
no opinion on such an important government order and Berg laughed
gaily

As to your business Prince Andrew continued addressing Bors we
will talk of it later and he looked round at Rostv Come to me
after the review and we will do what is possible

And having glanced round the room Prince Andrew turned to Rostv
whose state of unconquerable childish embarrassment now changing to
anger he did not condescend to notice and said I think you were
talking of the Schon Grabern affair Were you there

I was there said Rostv angrily as if intending to insult the aide
decamp

Bolknski noticed the hussars state of mind and it amused him With a
slightly contemptuous smile he said Yes there are many stories now
told about that affair

Yes stories repeated Rostv loudly looking with eyes suddenly grown
furious now at Bors now at Bolknski Yes many stories But our
stories are the stories of men who have been under the enemys fire Our
stories have some weight not like the stories of those fellows on the
staff who get rewards without doing anything

Of whom you imagine me to be one said Prince Andrew with a quiet and
particularly amiable smile

A strange feeling of exasperation and yet of respect for this mans
selfpossession mingled at that moment in Rostvs soul

I am not talking about you he said I dont know you and frankly I
dont want to I am speaking of the staff in general

And I will tell you this Prince Andrew interrupted in a tone of quiet
authority you wish to insult me and I am ready to agree with you that
it would be very easy to do so if you havent sufficient selfrespect
but admit that the time and place are very badly chosen In a day or two
we shall all have to take part in a greater and more serious duel and
besides Drubetsky who says he is an old friend of yours is not at
all to blame that my face has the misfortune to displease you However
he added rising you know my name and where to find me but dont
forget that I do not regard either myself or you as having been at all
insulted and as a man older than you my advice is to let the matter
drop Well then on Friday after the review I shall expect you
Drubetsky Au revoir exclaimed Prince Andrew and with a bow to them
both he went out

Only when Prince Andrew was gone did Rostv think of what he ought to
have said And he was still more angry at having omitted to say it He
ordered his horse at once and coldly taking leave of Bors rode home
Should he go to headquarters next day and challenge that affected
adjutant or really let the matter drop was the question that worried
him all the way He thought angrily of the pleasure he would have at
seeing the fright of that small and frail but proud man when covered by
his pistol and then he felt with surprise that of all the men he knew
there was none he would so much like to have for a friend as that very
adjutant whom he so hated





CHAPTER VIII

The day after Rostv had been to see Bors a review was held of the
Austrian and Russian troops both those freshly arrived from Russia and
those who had been campaigning under Kutzov The two Emperors the
Russian with his heir the Tsarevich and the Austrian with the Archduke
inspected the allied army of eighty thousand men

From early morning the smart clean troops were on the move forming up
on the field before the fortress Now thousands of feet and bayonets
moved and halted at the officers command turned with banners flying
formed up at intervals and wheeled round other similar masses of
infantry in different uniforms now was heard the rhythmic beat of hoofs
and the jingling of showy cavalry in blue red and green braided
uniforms with smartly dressed bandsmen in front mounted on black roan
or gray horses then again spreading out with the brazen clatter of the
polished shining cannon that quivered on the gun carriages and with the
smell of linstocks came the artillery which crawled between the
infantry and cavalry and took up its appointed position Not only the
generals in full parade uniforms with their thin or thick waists drawn
in to the utmost their red necks squeezed into their stiff collars and
wearing scarves and all their decorations not only the elegant pomaded
officers but every soldier with his freshly washed and shaven face and
his weapons clean and polished to the utmost and every horse groomed
till its coat shone like satin and every hair of its wetted mane lay
smoothfelt that no small matter was happening but an important and
solemn affair Every general and every soldier was conscious of his own
insignificance aware of being but a drop in that ocean of men and yet
at the same time was conscious of his strength as a part of that
enormous whole

From early morning strenuous activities and efforts had begun and by ten
oclock all had been brought into due order The ranks were drawn up on
the vast field The whole army was extended in three lines the cavalry
in front behind it the artillery and behind that again the infantry

A space like a street was left between each two lines of troops The
three parts of that army were sharply distinguished Kutzovs fighting
army with the Pvlograds on the right flank of the front those
recently arrived from Russia both Guards and regiments of the line and
the Austrian troops But they all stood in the same lines under one
command and in a like order

Like wind over leaves ran an excited whisper Theyre coming Theyre
coming Alarmed voices were heard and a stir of final preparation
swept over all the troops

From the direction of Olmutz in front of them a group was seen
approaching And at that moment though the day was still a light gust
of wind blowing over the army slightly stirred the streamers on the
lances and the unfolded standards fluttered against their staffs It
looked as if by that slight motion the army itself was expressing its
joy at the approach of the Emperors One voice was heard shouting Eyes
front Then like the crowing of cocks at sunrise this was repeated by
others from various sides and all became silent

In the deathlike stillness only the tramp of horses was heard This was
the Emperors suites The Emperors rode up to the flank and the
trumpets of the first cavalry regiment played the general march It
seemed as though not the trumpeters were playing but as if the army
itself rejoicing at the Emperors approach had naturally burst into
music Amid these sounds only the youthful kindly voice of the Emperor
Alexander was clearly heard He gave the words of greeting and the
first regiment roared Hurrah so deafeningly continuously and
joyfully that the men themselves were awed by their multitude and the
immensity of the power they constituted

Rostv standing in the front lines of Kutzovs army which the Tsar
approached first experienced the same feeling as every other man in
that army a feeling of selfforgetfulness a proud consciousness of
might and a passionate attraction to him who was the cause of this
triumph

He felt that at a single word from that man all this vast mass and he
himself an insignificant atom in it would go through fire and water
commit crime die or perform deeds of highest heroism and so he could
not but tremble and his heart stand still at the imminence of that word

Hurrah Hurrah Hurrah thundered from all sides one regiment after
another greeting the Tsar with the strains of the march and then
Hurrah Then the general march and again Hurrah Hurrah growing
ever stronger and fuller and merging into a deafening roar

Till the Tsar reached it each regiment in its silence and immobility
seemed like a lifeless body but as soon as he came up it became alive
its thunder joining the roar of the whole line along which he had
already passed Through the terrible and deafening roar of those voices
amid the square masses of troops standing motionless as if turned to
stone hundreds of riders composing the suites moved carelessly but
symmetrically and above all freely and in front of them two menthe
Emperors Upon them the undivided tensely passionate attention of that
whole mass of men was concentrated

The handsome young Emperor Alexander in the uniform of the Horse
Guards wearing a cocked hat with its peaks front and back with his
pleasant face and resonant though not loud voice attracted everyones
attention

Rostv was not far from the trumpeters and with his keen sight had
recognized the Tsar and watched his approach When he was within twenty
paces and Nicholas could clearly distinguish every detail of his
handsome happy young face he experienced a feeling of tenderness and
ecstasy such as he had never before known Every trait and every
movement of the Tsars seemed to him enchanting

Stopping in front of the Pvlograds the Tsar said something in French
to the Austrian Emperor and smiled

Seeing that smile Rostv involuntarily smiled himself and felt a still
stronger flow of love for his sovereign He longed to show that love in
some way and knowing that this was impossible was ready to cry The Tsar
called the colonel of the regiment and said a few words to him

Oh God what would happen to me if the Emperor spoke to me thought
Rostv I should die of happiness

The Tsar addressed the officers also I thank you all gentlemen I
thank you with my whole heart To Rostv every word sounded like a
voice from heaven How gladly would he have died at once for his Tsar

You have earned the St Georges standards and will be worthy of them

Oh to die to die for him thought Rostv

The Tsar said something more which Rostv did not hear and the
soldiers straining their lungs shouted Hurrah

Rostv too bending over his saddle shouted Hurrah with all his
might feeling that he would like to injure himself by that shout if
only to express his rapture fully

The Tsar stopped a few minutes in front of the hussars as if undecided

How can the Emperor be undecided thought Rostv but then even this
indecision appeared to him majestic and enchanting like everything else
the Tsar did

That hesitation lasted only an instant The Tsars foot in the narrow
pointed boot then fashionable touched the groin of the bobtailed bay
mare he rode his hand in a white glove gathered up the reins and he
moved off accompanied by an irregularly swaying sea of aidesdecamp
Farther and farther he rode away stopping at other regiments till at
last only his white plumes were visible to Rostv from amid the suites
that surrounded the Emperors

Among the gentlemen of the suite Rostv noticed Bolknski sitting his
horse indolently and carelessly Rostv recalled their quarrel of
yesterday and the question presented itself whether he ought or ought
not to challenge Bolknski Of course not he now thought Is it
worth thinking or speaking of it at such a moment At a time of such
love such rapture and such selfsacrifice what do any of our quarrels
and affronts matter I love and forgive everybody now

When the Emperor had passed nearly all the regiments the troops began a
ceremonial march past him and Rostv on Bedouin recently purchased
from Denisov rode past too at the rear of his squadronthat is alone
and in full view of the Emperor

Before he reached him Rostv who was a splendid horseman spurred
Bedouin twice and successfully put him to the showy trot in which the
animal went when excited Bending his foaming muzzle to his chest his
tail extended Bedouin as if also conscious of the Emperors eye upon
him passed splendidly lifting his feet with a high and graceful
action as if flying through the air without touching the ground

Rostv himself his legs well back and his stomach drawn in and feeling
himself one with his horse rode past the Emperor with a frowning but
blissful face like a vewy devil as Denisov expressed it

Fine fellows the Pvlograds remarked the Emperor

My God how happy I should be if he ordered me to leap into the fire
this instant thought Rostv

When the review was over the newly arrived officers and also
Kutzovs collected in groups and began to talk about the awards about
the Austrians and their uniforms about their lines about Bonaparte
and how badly the latter would fare now especially if the Essen corps
arrived and Prussia took our side

But the talk in every group was chiefly about the Emperor Alexander His
every word and movement was described with ecstasy

They all had but one wish to advance as soon as possible against the
enemy under the Emperors command Commanded by the Emperor himself they
could not fail to vanquish anyone be it whom it might so thought
Rostv and most of the officers after the review

All were then more confident of victory than the winning of two battles
would have made them





CHAPTER IX

The day after the review Bors in his best uniform and with his
comrade Bergs best wishes for success rode to Olmutz to see Bolknski
wishing to profit by his friendliness and obtain for himself the best
post he couldpreferably that of adjutant to some important personage a
position in the army which seemed to him most attractive It is all
very well for Rostv whose father sends him ten thousand rubles at a
time to talk about not wishing to cringe to anybody and not be anyones
lackey but I who have nothing but my brains have to make a career and
must not miss opportunities but must avail myself of them he
reflected

He did not find Prince Andrew in Olmutz that day but the appearance of
the town where the headquarters and the diplomatic corps were stationed
and the two Emperors were living with their suites households and
courts only strengthened his desire to belong to that higher world

He knew no one and despite his smart Guardsmans uniform all these
exalted personages passing in the streets in their elegant carriages
with their plumes ribbons and medals both courtiers and military men
seemed so immeasurably above him an insignificant officer of the
Guards that they not only did not wish to but simply could not be
aware of his existence At the quarters of the commanderinchief
Kutzov where he inquired for Bolknski all the adjutants and even the
orderlies looked at him as if they wished to impress on him that a great
many officers like him were always coming there and that everybody was
heartily sick of them In spite of this or rather because of it next
day November 15 after dinner he again went to Olmutz and entering the
house occupied by Kutzov asked for Bolknski Prince Andrew was in and
Bors was shown into a large hall probably formerly used for dancing
but in which five beds now stood and furniture of various kinds a
table chairs and a clavichord One adjutant nearest the door was
sitting at the table in a Persian dressing gown writing Another the
red stout Nesvtski lay on a bed with his arms under his head
laughing with an officer who had sat down beside him A third was
playing a Viennese waltz on the clavichord while a fourth lying on the
clavichord sang the tune Bolknski was not there None of these
gentlemen changed his position on seeing Bors The one who was writing
and whom Bors addressed turned round crossly and told him Bolknski was
on duty and that he should go through the door on the left into the
reception room if he wished to see him Bors thanked him and went to
the reception room where he found some ten officers and generals

When he entered Prince Andrew his eyes drooping contemptuously with
that peculiar expression of polite weariness which plainly says If it
were not my duty I would not talk to you for a moment was listening
to an old Russian general with decorations who stood very erect almost
on tiptoe with a soldiers obsequious expression on his purple face
reporting something

Very well then be so good as to wait said Prince Andrew to the
general in Russian speaking with the French intonation he affected
when he wished to speak contemptuously and noticing Bors Prince
Andrew paying no more heed to the general who ran after him imploring
him to hear something more nodded and turned to him with a cheerful
smile

At that moment Bors clearly realized what he had before surmised that
in the army besides the subordination and discipline prescribed in the
military code which he and the others knew in the regiment there was
another more important subordination which made this tightlaced
purplefaced general wait respectfully while Captain Prince Andrew for
his own pleasure chose to chat with Lieutenant Drubetsky More than
ever was Bors resolved to serve in future not according to the written
code but under this unwritten law He felt now that merely by having
been recommended to Prince Andrew he had already risen above the general
who at the front had the power to annihilate him a lieutenant of the
Guards Prince Andrew came up to him and took his hand

I am very sorry you did not find me in yesterday I was fussing about
with Germans all day We went with Weyrother to survey the dispositions
When Germans start being accurate theres no end to it

Bors smiled as if he understood what Prince Andrew was alluding to as
something generally known But it was the first time he had heard
Weyrothers name or even the term dispositions

Well my dear fellow so you still want to be an adjutant I have been
thinking about you

Yes I was thinkingfor some reason Bors could not help blushingof
asking the commanderinchief He has had a letter from Prince Kurgin
about me I only wanted to ask because I fear the Guards wont be in
action he added as if in apology

All right all right Well talk it over replied Prince Andrew Only
let me report this gentlemans business and I shall be at your
disposal

While Prince Andrew went to report about the purplefaced general that
gentlemanevidently not sharing Bors conception of the advantages of
the unwritten code of subordinationlooked so fixedly at the
presumptuous lieutenant who had prevented his finishing what he had to
say to the adjutant that Bors felt uncomfortable He turned away and
waited impatiently for Prince Andrews return from the commanderin
chiefs room

You see my dear fellow I have been thinking about you said Prince
Andrew when they had gone into the large room where the clavichord was
Its no use your going to the commanderinchief He would say a lot of
pleasant things ask you to dinner That would not be bad as regards
the unwritten code thought Bors but nothing more would come of it
There will soon be a battalion of us aidesdecamp and adjutants But
this is what well do I have a good friend an adjutant general and an
excellent fellow Prince Dolgorukov and though you may not know it the
fact is that now Kutzov with his staff and all of us count for nothing
Everything is now centered round the Emperor So we will go to
Dolgorukov I have to go there anyhow and I have already spoken to him
about you We shall see whether he cannot attach you to himself or find
a place for you somewhere nearer the sun

Prince Andrew always became specially keen when he had to guide a young
man and help him to worldly success Under cover of obtaining help of
this kind for another which from pride he would never accept for
himself he kept in touch with the circle which confers success and
which attracted him He very readily took up Bors cause and went with
him to Dolgorukov

It was late in the evening when they entered the palace at Olmutz
occupied by the Emperors and their retinues

That same day a council of war had been held in which all the members of
the Hofkriegsrath and both Emperors took part At that council contrary
to the views of the old generals Kutzov and Prince Schwartzenberg it
had been decided to advance immediately and give battle to Bonaparte
The council of war was just over when Prince Andrew accompanied by Bors
arrived at the palace to find Dolgorukov Everyone at headquarters was
still under the spell of the days council at which the party of the
young had triumphed The voices of those who counseled delay and advised
waiting for something else before advancing had been so completely
silenced and their arguments confuted by such conclusive evidence of the
advantages of attacking that what had been discussed at the councilthe
coming battle and the victory that would certainly result from itno
longer seemed to be in the future but in the past All the advantages
were on our side Our enormous forces undoubtedly superior to
Napoleons were concentrated in one place the troops inspired by the
Emperors presence were eager for action The strategic position where
the operations would take place was familiar in all its details to the
Austrian General Weyrother a lucky accident had ordained that the
Austrian army should maneuver the previous year on the very fields where
the French had now to be fought the adjacent locality was known and
shown in every detail on the maps and Bonaparte evidently weakened
was undertaking nothing

Dolgorukov one of the warmest advocates of an attack had just returned
from the council tired and exhausted but eager and proud of the victory
that had been gained Prince Andrew introduced his protege but Prince
Dolgorukov politely and firmly pressing his hand said nothing to Bors
and evidently unable to suppress the thoughts which were uppermost in
his mind at that moment addressed Prince Andrew in French

Ah my dear fellow what a battle we have gained God grant that the
one that will result from it will be as victorious However dear
fellow he said abruptly and eagerly I must confess to having been
unjust to the Austrians and especially to Weyrother What exactitude
what minuteness what knowledge of the locality what foresight for
every eventuality every possibility even to the smallest detail No my
dear fellow no conditions better than our present ones could have been
devised This combination of Austrian precision with Russian valorwhat
more could be wished for

So the attack is definitely resolved on asked Bolknski

And do you know my dear fellow it seems to me that Bonaparte has
decidedly lost bearings you know that a letter was received from him
today for the Emperor Dolgorukov smiled significantly

Is that so And what did he say inquired Bolknski

What can he say Tradiridira and so on merely to gain time I
tell you he is in our hands thats certain But what was most amusing
he continued with a sudden goodnatured laugh was that we could not
think how to address the reply If not as Consul and of course not as
Emperor it seemed to me it should be to General Bonaparte

But between not recognizing him as Emperor and calling him General
Bonaparte there is a difference remarked Bolknski

Thats just it interrupted Dolgorukov quickly laughing You know
Bilibinhes a very clever fellow He suggested addressing him as
Usurper and Enemy of Mankind

Dolgorukov laughed merrily

Only that said Bolknski

All the same it was Bilibin who found a suitable form for the address
He is a wise and clever fellow

What was it

To the Head of the French Government Au chef du gouvernement
francais said Dolgorukov with grave satisfaction Good wasnt it

Yes but he will dislike it extremely said Bolknski

Oh yes very much My brother knows him hes dined with himthe
present Emperormore than once in Paris and tells me he never met a
more cunning or subtle diplomatistyou know a combination of French
adroitness and Italian playacting Do you know the tale about him and
Count Markov Count Markov was the only man who knew how to handle him
You know the story of the handkerchief It is delightful

And the talkative Dolgorukov turning now to Bors now to Prince
Andrew told how Bonaparte wishing to test Markov our ambassador
purposely dropped a handkerchief in front of him and stood looking at
Markov probably expecting Markov to pick it up for him and how Markov
immediately dropped his own beside it and picked it up without touching
Bonapartes

Delightful said Bolknski But I have come to you Prince as a
petitioner on behalf of this young man You see but before Prince
Andrew could finish an aidedecamp came in to summon Dolgorukov to the
Emperor

Oh what a nuisance said Dolgorukov getting up hurriedly and
pressing the hands of Prince Andrew and Bors You know I should be
very glad to do all in my power both for you and for this dear young
man Again he pressed the hand of the latter with an expression of
goodnatured sincere and animated levity But you see another
time

Bors was excited by the thought of being so close to the higher powers
as he felt himself to be at that moment He was conscious that here he
was in contact with the springs that set in motion the enormous
movements of the mass of which in his regiment he felt himself a tiny
obedient and insignificant atom They followed Prince Dolgorukov out
into the corridor and metcoming out of the door of the Emperors room
by which Dolgorukov had entereda short man in civilian clothes with a
clever face and sharply projecting jaw which without spoiling his face
gave him a peculiar vivacity and shiftiness of expression This short
man nodded to Dolgorukov as to an intimate friend and stared at Prince
Andrew with cool intensity walking straight toward him and evidently
expecting him to bow or to step out of his way Prince Andrew did
neither a look of animosity appeared on his face and the other turned
away and went down the side of the corridor

Who was that asked Bors

He is one of the most remarkable but to me most unpleasant of menthe
Minister of Foreign Affairs Prince Adam Czartoryski It is such men
as he who decide the fate of nations added Bolknski with a sigh he
could not suppress as they passed out of the palace

Next day the army began its campaign and up to the very battle of
Austerlitz Bors was unable to see either Prince Andrew or Dolgorukov
again and remained for a while with the Ismaylov regiment





CHAPTER X

At dawn on the sixteenth of November Denisovs squadron in which
Nicholas Rostv served and which was in Prince Bagrations detachment
moved from the place where it had spent the night advancing into action
as arranged and after going behind other columns for about two thirds
of a mile was stopped on the highroad Rostv saw the Cossacks and then
the first and second squadrons of hussars and infantry battalions and
artillery pass by and go forward and then Generals Bagration and
Dolgorukov ride past with their adjutants All the fear before action
which he had experienced as previously all the inner struggle to
conquer that fear all his dreams of distinguishing himself as a true
hussar in this battle had been wasted Their squadron remained in
reserve and Nicholas Rostv spent that day in a dull and wretched mood
At nine in the morning he heard firing in front and shouts of hurrah
and saw wounded being brought back there were not many of them and at
last he saw how a whole detachment of French cavalry was brought in
convoyed by a sotnya of Cossacks Evidently the affair was over and
though not big had been a successful engagement The men and officers
returning spoke of a brilliant victory of the occupation of the town of
Wischau and the capture of a whole French squadron The day was bright
and sunny after a sharp night frost and the cheerful glitter of that
autumn day was in keeping with the news of victory which was conveyed
not only by the tales of those who had taken part in it but also by the
joyful expression on the faces of soldiers officers generals and
adjutants as they passed Rostv going or coming And Nicholas who had
vainly suffered all the dread that precedes a battle and had spent that
happy day in inactivity was all the more depressed

Come here Wostov Lets dwink to dwown our gwief shouted Denisov
who had settled down by the roadside with a flask and some food

The officers gathered round Denisovs canteen eating and talking

There They are bringing another cried one of the officers
indicating a captive French dragoon who was being brought in on foot by
two Cossacks

One of them was leading by the bridle a fine large French horse he had
taken from the prisoner

Sell us that horse Denisov called out to the Cossacks

If you like your honor

The officers got up and stood round the Cossacks and their prisoner The
French dragoon was a young Alsatian who spoke French with a German
accent He was breathless with agitation his face was red and when he
heard some French spoken he at once began speaking to the officers
addressing first one then another He said he would not have been
taken it was not his fault but the corporals who had sent him to seize
some horsecloths though he had told him the Russians were there And at
every word he added But dont hurt my little horse and stroked the
animal It was plain that he did not quite grasp where he was Now he
excused himself for having been taken prisoner and now imagining
himself before his own officers insisted on his soldierly discipline
and zeal in the service He brought with him into our rearguard all the
freshness of atmosphere of the French army which was so alien to us

The Cossacks sold the horse for two gold pieces and Rostv being the
richest of the officers now that he had received his money bought it

But dont hurt my little horse said the Alsatian goodnaturedly to
Rostv when the animal was handed over to the hussar

Rostv smilingly reassured the dragoon and gave him money

Alley Alley said the Cossack touching the prisoners arm to make
him go on

The Emperor The Emperor was suddenly heard among the hussars

All began to run and bustle and Rostv saw coming up the road behind
him several riders with white plumes in their hats In a moment everyone
was in his place waiting

Rostv did not know or remember how he ran to his place and mounted
Instantly his regret at not having been in action and his dejected mood
amid people of whom he was weary had gone instantly every thought of
himself had vanished He was filled with happiness at his nearness to
the Emperor He felt that this nearness by itself made up to him for the
day he had lost He was happy as a lover when the longedfor moment of
meeting arrives Not daring to look round and without looking round he
was ecstatically conscious of his approach He felt it not only from the
sound of the hoofs of the approaching cavalcade but because as he drew
near everything grew brighter more joyful more significant and more
festive around him Nearer and nearer to Rostv came that sun shedding
beams of mild and majestic light around and already he felt himself
enveloped in those beams he heard his voice that kindly calm and
majestic voice that was yet so simple And as if in accord with Rostvs
feeling there was a deathly stillness amid which was heard the
Emperors voice

The Pvlograd hussars he inquired

The reserves sire replied a voice a very human one compared to that
which had said The Pvlograd hussars

The Emperor drew level with Rostv and halted Alexanders face was even
more beautiful than it had been three days before at the review It
shone with such gaiety and youth such innocent youth that it suggested
the liveliness of a fourteenyearold boy and yet it was the face of
the majestic Emperor Casually while surveying the squadron the
Emperors eyes met Rostvs and rested on them for not more than two
seconds Whether or no the Emperor understood what was going on in
Rostvs soul it seemed to Rostv that he understood everything at
any rate his lightblue eyes gazed for about two seconds into Rostvs
face A gentle mild light poured from them Then all at once he raised
his eyebrows abruptly touched his horse with his left foot and
galloped on

The younger Emperor could not restrain his wish to be present at the
battle and in spite of the remonstrances of his courtiers at twelve
oclock left the third column with which he had been and galloped toward
the vanguard Before he came up with the hussars several adjutants met
him with news of the successful result of the action

This battle which consisted in the capture of a French squadron was
represented as a brilliant victory over the French and so the Emperor
and the whole army especially while the smoke hung over the
battlefield believed that the French had been defeated and were
retreating against their will A few minutes after the Emperor had
passed the Pvlograd division was ordered to advance In Wischau
itself a petty German town Rostv saw the Emperor again In the market
place where there had been some rather heavy firing before the
Emperors arrival lay several killed and wounded soldiers whom there
had not been time to move The Emperor surrounded by his suite of
officers and courtiers was riding a bobtailed chestnut mare a
different one from that which he had ridden at the review and bending
to one side he gracefully held a gold lorgnette to his eyes and looked
at a soldier who lay prone with blood on his uncovered head The
wounded soldier was so dirty coarse and revolting that his proximity
to the Emperor shocked Rostv Rostv saw how the Emperors rather round
shoulders shuddered as if a cold shiver had run down them how his left
foot began convulsively tapping the horses side with the spur and how
the welltrained horse looked round unconcerned and did not stir An
adjutant dismounting lifted the soldier under the arms to place him on
a stretcher that had been brought The soldier groaned

Gently gently Cant you do it more gently said the Emperor
apparently suffering more than the dying soldier and he rode away

Rostv saw tears filling the Emperors eyes and heard him as he was
riding away say to Czartoryski What a terrible thing war is what a
terrible thing Quelle terrible chose que la guerre

The troops of the vanguard were stationed before Wischau within sight
of the enemys lines which all day long had yielded ground to us at the
least firing The Emperors gratitude was announced to the vanguard
rewards were promised and the men received a double ration of vodka
The campfires crackled and the soldiers songs resounded even more
merrily than on the previous night Denisov celebrated his promotion to
the rank of major and Rostv who had already drunk enough at the end
of the feast proposed the Emperors health Not our Sovereign the
Emperor as they say at official dinners said he but the health of
our Sovereign that good enchanting and great man Let us drink to his
health and to the certain defeat of the French

If we fought before he said not letting the French pass as at
Schon Grabern what shall we not do now when he is at the front We will
all die for him gladly Is it not so gentlemen Perhaps I am not saying
it right I have drunk a good dealbut that is how I feel and so do you
too To the health of Alexander the First Hurrah

Hurrah rang the enthusiastic voices of the officers

And the old cavalry captain Kirsten shouted enthusiastically and no
less sincerely than the twentyyearold Rostv

When the officers had emptied and smashed their glasses Kirsten filled
others and in shirt sleeves and breeches went glass in hand to the
soldiers bonfires and with his long gray mustache his white chest
showing under his open shirt he stood in a majestic pose in the light
of the campfire waving his uplifted arm

Lads heres to our Sovereign the Emperor and victory over our
enemies Hurrah he exclaimed in his dashing old hussars baritone

The hussars crowded round and responded heartily with loud shouts

Late that night when all had separated Denisov with his short hand
patted his favorite Rostv on the shoulder

As theres no one to fall in love with on campaign hes fallen in love
with the Tsar he said

Denisov dont make fun of it cried Rostv It is such a lofty
beautiful feeling such a

I believe it I believe it fwiend and I share and appwove

No you dont understand

And Rostv got up and went wandering among the campfires dreaming of
what happiness it would be to dienot in saving the Emperors life he
did not even dare to dream of that but simply to die before his eyes
He really was in love with the Tsar and the glory of the Russian arms
and the hope of future triumph And he was not the only man to
experience that feeling during those memorable days preceding the battle
of Austerlitz nine tenths of the men in the Russian army were then in
love though less ecstatically with their Tsar and the glory of the
Russian arms





CHAPTER XI

The next day the Emperor stopped at Wischau and Villier his physician
was repeatedly summoned to see him At headquarters and among the troops
near by the news spread that the Emperor was unwell He ate nothing and
had slept badly that night those around him reported The cause of this
indisposition was the strong impression made on his sensitive mind by
the sight of the killed and wounded

At daybreak on the seventeenth a French officer who had come with a
flag of truce demanding an audience with the Russian Emperor was
brought into Wischau from our outposts This officer was Savary The
Emperor had only just fallen asleep and so Savary had to wait At midday
he was admitted to the Emperor and an hour later he rode off with
Prince Dolgorukov to the advanced post of the French army

It was rumored that Savary had been sent to propose to Alexander a
meeting with Napoleon To the joy and pride of the whole army a
personal interview was refused and instead of the Sovereign Prince
Dolgorukov the victor at Wischau was sent with Savary to negotiate
with Napoleon if contrary to expectations these negotiations were
actuated by a real desire for peace

Toward evening Dolgorukov came back went straight to the Tsar and
remained alone with him for a long time

On the eighteenth and nineteenth of November the army advanced two
days march and the enemys outposts after a brief interchange of shots
retreated In the highest army circles from midday on the nineteenth a
great excitedly bustling activity began which lasted till the morning
of the twentieth when the memorable battle of Austerlitz was fought

Till midday on the nineteenth the activitythe eager talk running to
and fro and dispatching of adjutantswas confined to the Emperors
headquarters But on the afternoon of that day this activity reached
Kutzovs headquarters and the staffs of the commanders of columns By
evening the adjutants had spread it to all ends and parts of the army
and in the night from the nineteenth to the twentieth the whole eighty
thousand allied troops rose from their bivouacs to the hum of voices
and the army swayed and started in one enormous mass six miles long

The concentrated activity which had begun at the Emperors headquarters
in the morning and had started the whole movement that followed was like
the first movement of the main wheel of a large tower clock One wheel
slowly moved another was set in motion and a third and wheels began
to revolve faster and faster levers and cogwheels to work chimes to
play figures to pop out and the hands to advance with regular motion
as a result of all that activity

Just as in the mechanism of a clock so in the mechanism of the military
machine an impulse once given leads to the final result and just as
indifferently quiescent till the moment when motion is transmitted to
them are the parts of the mechanism which the impulse has not yet
reached Wheels creak on their axles as the cogs engage one another and
the revolving pulleys whirr with the rapidity of their movement but a
neighboring wheel is as quiet and motionless as though it were prepared
to remain so for a hundred years but the moment comes when the lever
catches it and obeying the impulse that wheel begins to creak and joins
in the common motion the result and aim of which are beyond its ken

Just as in a clock the result of the complicated motion of innumerable
wheels and pulleys is merely a slow and regular movement of the hands
which show the time so the result of all the complicated human
activities of 160000 Russians and Frenchall their passions desires
remorse humiliations sufferings outbursts of pride fear and
enthusiasmwas only the loss of the battle of Austerlitz the socalled
battle of the three Emperorsthat is to say a slow movement of the hand
on the dial of human history

Prince Andrew was on duty that day and in constant attendance on the
commanderinchief

At six in the evening Kutzov went to the Emperors headquarters and
after staying but a short time with the Tsar went to see the grand
marshal of the court Count Tolsty

Bolknski took the opportunity to go in to get some details of the
coming action from Dolgorukov He felt that Kutzov was upset and
dissatisfied about something and that at headquarters they were
dissatisfied with him and also that at the Emperors headquarters
everyone adopted toward him the tone of men who know something others do
not know he therefore wished to speak to Dolgorukov

Well how dyou do my dear fellow said Dolgorukov who was sitting
at tea with Bilibin The fete is for tomorrow How is your old fellow
Out of sorts

I wont say he is out of sorts but I fancy he would like to be heard

But they heard him at the council of war and will hear him when he
talks sense but to temporize and wait for something now when Bonaparte
fears nothing so much as a general battle is impossible

Yes you have seen him said Prince Andrew Well what is Bonaparte
like How did he impress you

Yes I saw him and am convinced that he fears nothing so much as a
general engagement repeated Dolgorukov evidently prizing this general
conclusion which he had arrived at from his interview with Napoleon If
he werent afraid of a battle why did he ask for that interview Why
negotiate and above all why retreat when to retreat is so contrary to
his method of conducting war Believe me he is afraid afraid of a
general battle His hour has come Mark my words

But tell me what is he like eh said Prince Andrew again

He is a man in a gray overcoat very anxious that I should call him
Your Majesty but who to his chagrin got no title from me Thats
the sort of man he is and nothing more replied Dolgorukov looking
round at Bilibin with a smile

Despite my great respect for old Kutzov he continued we should be
a nice set of fellows if we were to wait about and so give him a chance
to escape or to trick us now that we certainly have him in our hands
No we mustnt forget Suvrov and his rulenot to put yourself in a
position to be attacked but yourself to attack Believe me in war the
energy of young men often shows the way better than all the experience
of old Cunctators

But in what position are we going to attack him I have been at the
outposts today and it is impossible to say where his chief forces are
situated said Prince Andrew

He wished to explain to Dolgorukov a plan of attack he had himself
formed

Oh that is all the same Dolgorukov said quickly and getting up he
spread a map on the table All eventualities have been foreseen If he
is standing before Brunn

And Prince Dolgorukov rapidly but indistinctly explained Weyrothers
plan of a flanking movement

Prince Andrew began to reply and to state his own plan which might have
been as good as Weyrothers but for the disadvantage that Weyrothers
had already been approved As soon as Prince Andrew began to demonstrate
the defects of the latter and the merits of his own plan Prince
Dolgorukov ceased to listen to him and gazed absentmindedly not at the
map but at Prince Andrews face

There will be a council of war at Kutzovs tonight though you can
say all this there remarked Dolgorukov

I will do so said Prince Andrew moving away from the map

Whatever are you bothering about gentlemen said Bilibin who till
then had listened with an amused smile to their conversation and now
was evidently ready with a joke Whether tomorrow brings victory or
defeat the glory of our Russian arms is secure Except your Kutzov
there is not a single Russian in command of a column The commanders
are Herr General Wimpfen le Comte de Langeron le Prince de
Lichtenstein le Prince de Hohenlohe and finally Prishprish and so on
like all those Polish names

Be quiet backbiter said Dolgorukov It is not true there are now
two Russians Miloradovich and Dokhturov and there would be a third
Count Arakcheev if his nerves were not too weak

However I think General Kutzov has come out said Prince Andrew I
wish you good luck and success gentlemen he added and went out after
shaking hands with Dolgorukov and Bilibin

On the way home Prince Andrew could not refrain from asking Kutzov
who was sitting silently beside him what he thought of tomorrows
battle

Kutzov looked sternly at his adjutant and after a pause replied I
think the battle will be lost and so I told Count Tolsty and asked him
to tell the Emperor What do you think he replied But my dear
general I am engaged with rice and cutlets look after military matters
yourself Yes That was the answer I got





CHAPTER XII

Shortly after nine oclock that evening Weyrother drove with his plans
to Kutzovs quarters where the council of war was to be held All the
commanders of columns were summoned to the commanderinchiefs and with
the exception of Prince Bagration who declined to come were all there
at the appointed time

Weyrother who was in full control of the proposed battle by his
eagerness and briskness presented a marked contrast to the dissatisfied
and drowsy Kutzov who reluctantly played the part of chairman and
president of the council of war Weyrother evidently felt himself to be
at the head of a movement that had already become unrestrainable He was
like a horse running downhill harnessed to a heavy cart Whether he was
pulling it or being pushed by it he did not know but rushed along at
headlong speed with no time to consider what this movement might lead
to Weyrother had been twice that evening to the enemys picket line to
reconnoiter personally and twice to the Emperors Russian and Austrian
to report and explain and to his headquarters where he had dictated the
dispositions in German and now much exhausted he arrived at
Kutzovs

He was evidently so busy that he even forgot to be polite to the
commander in chief He interrupted him talked rapidly and indistinctly
without looking at the man he was addressing and did not reply to
questions put to him He was bespattered with mud and had a pitiful
weary and distracted air though at the same time he was haughty and
selfconfident

Kutzov was occupying a noblemans castle of modest dimensions near
Ostralitz In the large drawing room which had become the commander in
chiefs office were gathered Kutzov himself Weyrother and the members
of the council of war They were drinking tea and only awaited Prince
Bagration to begin the council At last Bagrations orderly came with
the news that the prince could not attend Prince Andrew came in to
inform the commanderinchief of this and availing himself of
permission previously given him by Kutzov to be present at the council
he remained in the room

Since Prince Bagration is not coming we may begin said Weyrother
hurriedly rising from his seat and going up to the table on which an
enormous map of the environs of Brunn was spread out

Kutzov with his uniform unbuttoned so that his fat neck bulged over
his collar as if escaping was sitting almost asleep in a low chair
with his podgy old hands resting symmetrically on its arms At the sound
of Weyrothers voice he opened his one eye with an effort

Yes yes if you please It is already late said he and nodding his
head he let it droop and again closed his eye

If at first the members of the council thought that Kutzov was
pretending to sleep the sounds his nose emitted during the reading that
followed proved that the commanderinchief at that moment was absorbed
by a far more serious matter than a desire to show his contempt for the
dispositions or anything elsehe was engaged in satisfying the
irresistible human need for sleep He really was asleep Weyrother with
the gesture of a man too busy to lose a moment glanced at Kutzov and
having convinced himself that he was asleep took up a paper and in a
loud monotonous voice began to read out the dispositions for the
impending battle under a heading which he also read out

Dispositions for an attack on the enemy position behind Kobelnitz and
Sokolnitz November 30 1805

The dispositions were very complicated and difficult They began as
follows

As the enemys left wing rests on wooded hills and his right extends
along Kobelnitz and Sokolnitz behind the ponds that are there while we
on the other hand with our left wing by far outflank his right it is
advantageous to attack the enemys latter wing especially if we occupy
the villages of Sokolnitz and Kobelnitz whereby we can both fall on his
flank and pursue him over the plain between Schlappanitz and the
Thuerassa forest avoiding the defiles of Schlappanitz and Bellowitz
which cover the enemys front For this object it is necessary that
The first column marches The second column marches The third
column marches and so on read Weyrother

The generals seemed to listen reluctantly to the difficult dispositions
The tall fairhaired General Buxhowden stood leaning his back against
the wall his eyes fixed on a burning candle and seemed not to listen
or even to wish to be thought to listen Exactly opposite Weyrother
with his glistening wideopen eyes fixed upon him and his mustache
twisted upwards sat the ruddy Miloradovich in a military pose his
elbows turned outwards his hands on his knees and his shoulders
raised He remained stubbornly silent gazing at Weyrothers face and
only turned away his eyes when the Austrian chief of staff finished
reading Then Miloradovich looked round significantly at the other
generals But one could not tell from that significant look whether he
agreed or disagreed and was satisfied or not with the arrangements Next
to Weyrother sat Count Langeron who with a subtle smile that never left
his typically southern French face during the whole time of the reading
gazed at his delicate fingers which rapidly twirled by its corners a
gold snuffbox on which was a portrait In the middle of one of the
longest sentences he stopped the rotary motion of the snuffbox raised
his head and with inimical politeness lurking in the corners of his
thin lips interrupted Weyrother wishing to say something But the
Austrian general continuing to read frowned angrily and jerked his
elbows as if to say You can tell me your views later but now be so
good as to look at the map and listen Langeron lifted his eyes with an
expression of perplexity turned round to Miloradovich as if seeking an
explanation but meeting the latters impressive but meaningless gaze
drooped his eyes sadly and again took to twirling his snuffbox

A geography lesson he muttered as if to himself but loud enough to
be heard

Przebyszewski with respectful but dignified politeness held his hand
to his ear toward Weyrother with the air of a man absorbed in
attention Dohkturov a little man sat opposite Weyrother with an
assiduous and modest mien and stooping over the outspread map
conscientiously studied the dispositions and the unfamiliar locality He
asked Weyrother several times to repeat words he had not clearly heard
and the difficult names of villages Weyrother complied and Dohkturov
noted them down

When the reading which lasted more than an hour was over Langeron again
brought his snuffbox to rest and without looking at Weyrother or at
anyone in particular began to say how difficult it was to carry out
such a plan in which the enemys position was assumed to be known
whereas it was perhaps not known since the enemy was in movement
Langerons objections were valid but it was obvious that their chief aim
was to show General Weyrotherwho had read his dispositions with as much
selfconfidence as if he were addressing school childrenthat he had to
do not with fools but with men who could teach him something in
military matters

When the monotonous sound of Weyrothers voice ceased Kutzov opened
his eye as a miller wakes up when the soporific drone of the mill wheel
is interrupted He listened to what Langeron said as if remarking So
you are still at that silly business quickly closed his eye again and
let his head sink still lower

Langeron trying as virulently as possible to sting Weyrothers vanity
as author of the military plan argued that Bonaparte might easily
attack instead of being attacked and so render the whole of this plan
perfectly worthless Weyrother met all objections with a firm and
contemptuous smile evidently prepared beforehand to meet all objections
be they what they might

If he could attack us he would have done so today said he

So you think he is powerless said Langeron

He has forty thousand men at most replied Weyrother with the smile
of a doctor to whom an old wife wishes to explain the treatment of a
case

In that case he is inviting his doom by awaiting our attack said
Langeron with a subtly ironical smile again glancing round for support
to Miloradovich who was near him

But Miloradovich was at that moment evidently thinking of anything
rather than of what the generals were disputing about

Ma foi said he tomorrow we shall see all that on the battlefield

Weyrother again gave that smile which seemed to say that to him it was
strange and ridiculous to meet objections from Russian generals and to
have to prove to them what he had not merely convinced himself of but
had also convinced the sovereign Emperors of

The enemy has quenched his fires and a continual noise is heard from
his camp said he What does that mean Either he is retreating which
is the only thing we need fear or he is changing his position He
smiled ironically But even if he also took up a position in the
Thuerassa he merely saves us a great deal of trouble and all our
arrangements to the minutest detail remain the same

How is that began Prince Andrew who had for long been waiting an
opportunity to express his doubts

Kutzov here woke up coughed heavily and looked round at the generals

Gentlemen the dispositions for tomorrowor rather for today for it is
past midnightcannot now be altered said he You have heard them and
we shall all do our duty But before a battle there is nothing more
important he paused than to have a good sleep

He moved as if to rise The generals bowed and retired It was past
midnight Prince Andrew went out

The council of war at which Prince Andrew had not been able to express
his opinion as he had hoped to left on him a vague and uneasy
impression Whether Dolgorukov and Weyrother or Kutzov Langeron and
the others who did not approve of the plan of attack were righthe did
not know But was it really not possible for Kutzov to state his views
plainly to the Emperor Is it possible that on account of court and
personal considerations tens of thousands of lives and my life my
life he thought must be risked

Yes it is very likely that I shall be killed tomorrow he thought
And suddenly at this thought of death a whole series of most distant
most intimate memories rose in his imagination he remembered his last
parting from his father and his wife he remembered the days when he
first loved her He thought of her pregnancy and felt sorry for her and
for himself and in a nervously emotional and softened mood he went out
of the hut in which he was billeted with Nesvtski and began to walk up
and down before it

The night was foggy and through the fog the moonlight gleamed
mysteriously Yes tomorrow tomorrow he thought Tomorrow
everything may be over for me All these memories will be no more none
of them will have any meaning for me Tomorrow perhaps even certainly
I have a presentiment that for the first time I shall have to show all I
can do And his fancy pictured the battle its loss the concentration
of fighting at one point and the hesitation of all the commanders And
then that happy moment that Toulon for which he had so long waited
presents itself to him at last He firmly and clearly expresses his
opinion to Kutzov to Weyrother and to the Emperors All are struck by
the justness of his views but no one undertakes to carry them out so
he takes a regiment a divisionstipulates that no one is to interfere
with his arrangementsleads his division to the decisive point and
gains the victory alone But death and suffering suggested another
voice Prince Andrew however did not answer that voice and went on
dreaming of his triumphs The dispositions for the next battle are
planned by him alone Nominally he is only an adjutant on Kutzovs
staff but he does everything alone The next battle is won by him
alone Kutzov is removed and he is appointed Well and then asked
the other voice If before that you are not ten times wounded killed
or betrayed well what then Well then Prince Andrew answered
himself I dont know what will happen and dont want to know and
cant but if I want thiswant glory want to be known to men want to
be loved by them it is not my fault that I want it and want nothing but
that and live only for that Yes for that alone I shall never tell
anyone but oh God what am I to do if I love nothing but fame and
mens esteem Death wounds the loss of familyI fear nothing And
precious and dear as many persons are to mefather sister wifethose
dearest to meyet dreadful and unnatural as it seems I would give them
all at once for a moment of glory of triumph over men of love from men
I dont know and never shall know for the love of these men here he
thought as he listened to voices in Kutzovs courtyard The voices
were those of the orderlies who were packing up one voice probably a
coachmans was teasing Kutzovs old cook whom Prince Andrew knew and
who was called Tit He was saying Tit I say Tit

Well returned the old man

Go Tit thresh a bit said the wag

Oh go to the devil called out a voice drowned by the laughter of
the orderlies and servants

All the same I love and value nothing but triumph over them all I
value this mystic power and glory that is floating here above me in this
mist





CHAPTER XIII

That same night Rostv was with a platoon on skirmishing duty in front
of Bagrations detachment His hussars were placed along the line in
couples and he himself rode along the line trying to master the
sleepiness that kept coming over him An enormous space with our armys
campfires dimly glowing in the fog could be seen behind him in front
of him was misty darkness Rostv could see nothing peer as he would
into that foggy distance now something gleamed gray now there was
something black now little lights seemed to glimmer where the enemy
ought to be now he fancied it was only something in his own eyes His
eyes kept closing and in his fancy appearednow the Emperor now
Denisov and now Moscow memoriesand he again hurriedly opened his eyes
and saw close before him the head and ears of the horse he was riding
and sometimes when he came within six paces of them the black figures
of hussars but in the distance was still the same misty darkness Why
not It might easily happen thought Rostv that the Emperor will
meet me and give me an order as he would to any other officer hell
say Go and find out whats there There are many stories of his
getting to know an officer in just such a chance way and attaching him
to himself What if he gave me a place near him Oh how I would guard
him how I would tell him the truth how I would unmask his deceivers
And in order to realize vividly his love devotion to the sovereign
Rostv pictured to himself an enemy or a deceitful German whom he would
not only kill with pleasure but whom he would slap in the face before
the Emperor Suddenly a distant shout aroused him He started and opened
his eyes

Where am I Oh yes in the skirmishing line pass and
watchwordshaft Olmutz What a nuisance that our squadron will be in
reserve tomorrow he thought Ill ask leave to go to the front this
may be my only chance of seeing the Emperor It wont be long now before
I am off duty Ill take another turn and when I get back Ill go to the
general and ask him He readjusted himself in the saddle and touched up
his horse to ride once more round his hussars It seemed to him that it
was getting lighter To the left he saw a sloping descent lit up and
facing it a black knoll that seemed as steep as a wall On this knoll
there was a white patch that Rostv could not at all make out was it a
glade in the wood lit up by the moon or some unmelted snow or some
white houses He even thought something moved on that white spot I
expect its snow that spot a spotune tache he thought There
now its not a tache Natsha sister black eyes Na
tasha Wont she be surprised when I tell her how Ive seen the
Emperor Natsha take my sabretacheKeep to the right your
honor there are bushes here came the voice of an hussar past whom
Rostv was riding in the act of falling asleep Rostv lifted his head
that had sunk almost to his horses mane and pulled up beside the
hussar He was succumbing to irresistible youthful childish
drowsiness But what was I thinking I mustnt forget How shall I
speak to the Emperor No thats not itthats tomorrow Oh yes
Natsha sabretache saber them Whom The hussars Ah the
hussars with mustaches Along the Tverskaya Street rode the hussar with
mustaches I thought about him too just opposite Guryevs house
Old Guryev Oh but Denisovs a fine fellow But thats all nonsense
The chief thing is that the Emperor is here How he looked at me and
wished to say something but dared not No it was I who dared not
But thats nonsense the chief thing is not to forget the important
thing I was thinking of Yes Natasha sabretache oh yes yes Thats
right And his head once more sank to his horses neck All at once it
seemed to him that he was being fired at What What What Cut them
down What said Rostv waking up At the moment he opened his eyes
he heard in front of him where the enemy was the longdrawn shouts of
thousands of voices His horse and the horse of the hussar near him
pricked their ears at these shouts Over there where the shouting came
from a fire flared up and went out again then another and all along
the French line on the hill fires flared up and the shouting grew louder
and louder Rostv could hear the sound of French words but could not
distinguish them The din of many voices was too great all he could
hear was ahahah and rrrr

Whats that What do you make of it said Rostv to the hussar beside
him That must be the enemys camp

The hussar did not reply

Why dont you hear it Rostv asked again after waiting for a reply

Who can tell your honor replied the hussar reluctantly

From the direction it must be the enemy repeated Rostv

It may be he or it may be nothing muttered the hussar Its dark
Steady he cried to his fidgeting horse

Rostvs horse was also getting restive it pawed the frozen ground
pricking its ears at the noise and looking at the lights The shouting
grew still louder and merged into a general roar that only an army of
several thousand men could produce The lights spread farther and
farther probably along the line of the French camp Rostv no longer
wanted to sleep The gay triumphant shouting of the enemy army had a
stimulating effect on him Vive lEmpereur LEmpereur he now heard
distinctly

They cant be far off probably just beyond the stream he said to the
hussar beside him

The hussar only sighed without replying and coughed angrily The sound
of horses hoofs approaching at a trot along the line of hussars was
heard and out of the foggy darkness the figure of a sergeant of hussars
suddenly appeared looming huge as an elephant

Your honor the generals said the sergeant riding up to Rostv

Rostv still looking round toward the fires and the shouts rode with
the sergeant to meet some mounted men who were riding along the line
One was on a white horse Prince Bagration and Prince Dolgorukov with
their adjutants had come to witness the curious phenomenon of the lights
and shouts in the enemys camp Rostv rode up to Bagration reported to
him and then joined the adjutants listening to what the generals were
saying

Believe me said Prince Dolgorukov addressing Bagration it is
nothing but a trick He has retreated and ordered the rearguard to
kindle fires and make a noise to deceive us

Hardly said Bagration I saw them this evening on that knoll if
they had retreated they would have withdrawn from that too Officer
said Bagration to Rostv are the enemys skirmishers still there

They were there this evening but now I dont know your excellency
Shall I go with some of my hussars to see replied Rostv

Bagration stopped and before replying tried to see Rostvs face in
the mist

Well go and see he said after a pause

Yes sir

Rostv spurred his horse called to Sergeant Fedchenko and two other
hussars told them to follow him and trotted downhill in the direction
from which the shouting came He felt both frightened and pleased to be
riding alone with three hussars into that mysterious and dangerous misty
distance where no one had been before him Bagration called to him from
the hill not to go beyond the stream but Rostv pretended not to hear
him and did not stop but rode on and on continually mistaking bushes
for trees and gullies for men and continually discovering his mistakes
Having descended the hill at a trot he no longer saw either our own or
the enemys fires but heard the shouting of the French more loudly and
distinctly In the valley he saw before him something like a river but
when he reached it he found it was a road Having come out onto the road
he reined in his horse hesitating whether to ride along it or cross it
and ride over the black field up the hillside To keep to the road which
gleamed white in the mist would have been safer because it would be
easier to see people coming along it Follow me said he crossed the
road and began riding up the hill at a gallop toward the point where
the French pickets had been standing that evening

Your honor there he is cried one of the hussars behind him And
before Rostv had time to make out what the black thing was that had
suddenly appeared in the fog there was a flash followed by a report
and a bullet whizzing high up in the mist with a plaintive sound passed
out of hearing Another musket missed fire but flashed in the pan
Rostv turned his horse and galloped back Four more reports followed at
intervals and the bullets passed somewhere in the fog singing in
different tones Rostv reined in his horse whose spirits had risen
like his own at the firing and went back at a footpace Well some
more Some more a merry voice was saying in his soul But no more
shots came

Only when approaching Bagration did Rostv let his horse gallop again
and with his hand at the salute rode up to the general

Dolgorukov was still insisting that the French had retreated and had
only lit fires to deceive us

What does that prove he was saying as Rostv rode up They might
retreat and leave the pickets

Its plain that they have not all gone yet Prince said Bagration
Wait till tomorrow morning well find out everything tomorrow

The picket is still on the hill your excellency just where it was in
the evening reported Rostv stooping forward with his hand at the
salute and unable to repress the smile of delight induced by his ride
and especially by the sound of the bullets

Very good very good said Bagration Thank you officer

Your excellency said Rostv may I ask a favor

What is it

Tomorrow our squadron is to be in reserve May I ask to be attached to
the first squadron

Whats your name

Count Rostv

Oh very well you may stay in attendance on me

Count Ily Rostvs son asked Dolgorukov

But Rostv did not reply

Then I may reckon on it your excellency

I will give the order

Tomorrow very likely I may be sent with some message to the Emperor
thought Rostv

Thank God

The fires and shouting in the enemys army were occasioned by the fact
that while Napoleons proclamation was being read to the troops the
Emperor himself rode round his bivouacs The soldiers on seeing him
lit wisps of straw and ran after him shouting Vive lEmpereur
Napoleons proclamation was as follows

Soldiers The Russian army is advancing against you to avenge the
Austrian army of Ulm They are the same battalions you broke at
Hollabrunn and have pursued ever since to this place The position we
occupy is a strong one and while they are marching to go round me on
the right they will expose a flank to me Soldiers I will myself direct
your battalions I will keep out of fire if you with your habitual valor
carry disorder and confusion into the enemys ranks but should victory
be in doubt even for a moment you will see your Emperor exposing
himself to the first blows of the enemy for there must be no doubt of
victory especially on this day when what is at stake is the honor of
the French infantry so necessary to the honor of our nation

Do not break your ranks on the plea of removing the wounded Let every
man be fully imbued with the thought that we must defeat these hirelings
of England inspired by such hatred of our nation This victory will
conclude our campaign and we can return to winter quarters where fresh
French troops who are being raised in France will join us and the peace
I shall conclude will be worthy of my people of you and of myself

NAPOLEON




CHAPTER XIV

At five in the morning it was still quite dark The troops of the
center the reserves and Bagrations right flank had not yet moved but
on the left flank the columns of infantry cavalry and artillery which
were to be the first to descend the heights to attack the French right
flank and drive it into the Bohemian mountains according to plan were
already up and astir The smoke of the campfires into which they were
throwing everything superfluous made the eyes smart It was cold and
dark The officers were hurriedly drinking tea and breakfasting the
soldiers munching biscuit and beating a tattoo with their feet to warm
themselves gathering round the fires throwing into the flames the
remains of sheds chairs tables wheels tubs and everything that they
did not want or could not carry away with them Austrian column guides
were moving in and out among the Russian troops and served as heralds of
the advance As soon as an Austrian officer showed himself near a
commanding officers quarters the regiment began to move the soldiers
ran from the fires thrust their pipes into their boots their bags into
the carts got their muskets ready and formed rank The officers
buttoned up their coats buckled on their swords and pouches and moved
along the ranks shouting The train drivers and orderlies harnessed and
packed the wagons and tied on the loads The adjutants and battalion and
regimental commanders mounted crossed themselves gave final
instructions orders and commissions to the baggage men who remained
behind and the monotonous tramp of thousands of feet resounded The
column moved forward without knowing where and unable from the masses
around them the smoke and the increasing fog to see either the place
they were leaving or that to which they were going

A soldier on the march is hemmed in and borne along by his regiment as
much as a sailor is by his ship However far he has walked whatever
strange unknown and dangerous places he reaches just as a sailor is
always surrounded by the same decks masts and rigging of his ship so
the soldier always has around him the same comrades the same ranks the
same sergeant major Ivan Mtrich the same company dog Jack and the
same commanders The sailor rarely cares to know the latitude in which
his ship is sailing but on the day of battleheaven knows how and
whencea stern note of which all are conscious sounds in the moral
atmosphere of an army announcing the approach of something decisive and
solemn and awakening in the men an unusual curiosity On the day of
battle the soldiers excitedly try to get beyond the interests of their
regiment they listen intently look about and eagerly ask concerning
what is going on around them

The fog had grown so dense that though it was growing light they could
not see ten paces ahead Bushes looked like gigantic trees and level
ground like cliffs and slopes Anywhere on any side one might
encounter an enemy invisible ten paces off But the columns advanced for
a long time always in the same fog descending and ascending hills
avoiding gardens and enclosures going over new and unknown ground and
nowhere encountering the enemy On the contrary the soldiers became
aware that in front behind and on all sides other Russian columns
were moving in the same direction Every soldier felt glad to know that
to the unknown place where he was going many more of our men were going
too

There now the Kurskies have also gone past was being said in the
ranks

Its wonderful what a lot of our troops have gathered lads Last night
I looked at the campfires and there was no end of them A regular
Moscow

Though none of the column commanders rode up to the ranks or talked to
the men the commanders as we saw at the council of war were out of
humor and dissatisfied with the affair and so did not exert themselves
to cheer the men but merely carried out the orders yet the troops
marched gaily as they always do when going into action especially to
an attack But when they had marched for about an hour in the dense fog
the greater part of the men had to halt and an unpleasant consciousness
of some dislocation and blunder spread through the ranks How such a
consciousness is communicated is very difficult to define but it
certainly is communicated very surely and flows rapidly imperceptibly
and irrepressibly as water does in a creek Had the Russian army been
alone without any allies it might perhaps have been a long time before
this consciousness of mismanagement became a general conviction but as
it was the disorder was readily and naturally attributed to the stupid
Germans and everyone was convinced that a dangerous muddle had been
occasioned by the sausage eaters

Why have we stopped Is the way blocked Or have we already come up
against the French

No one cant hear them Theyd be firing if we had

They were in a hurry enough to start us and now here we stand in the
middle of a field without rhyme or reason Its all those damned
Germans muddling What stupid devils

Yes Id send them on in front but no fear theyre crowding up
behind And now here we stand hungry

I say shall we soon be clear They say the cavalry are blocking the
way said an officer

Ah those damned Germans They dont know their own country said
another

What division are you shouted an adjutant riding up

The Eighteenth

Then why are you here You should have gone on long ago now you wont
get there till evening

What stupid orders They dont themselves know what they are doing
said the officer and rode off

Then a general rode past shouting something angrily not in Russian

Tafalafa But what hes jabbering no one can make out said a
soldier mimicking the general who had ridden away Id shoot them the
scoundrels

We were ordered to be at the place before nine but we havent got
halfway Fine orders was being repeated on different sides

And the feeling of energy with which the troops had started began to
turn into vexation and anger at the stupid arrangements and at the
Germans

The cause of the confusion was that while the Austrian cavalry was
moving toward our left flank the higher command found that our center
was too far separated from our right flank and the cavalry were all
ordered to turn back to the right Several thousand cavalry crossed in
front of the infantry who had to wait

At the front an altercation occurred between an Austrian guide and a
Russian general The general shouted a demand that the cavalry should be
halted the Austrian argued that not he but the higher command was to
blame The troops meanwhile stood growing listless and dispirited After
an hours delay they at last moved on descending the hill The fog that
was dispersing on the hill lay still more densely below where they were
descending In front in the fog a shot was heard and then another at
first irregularly at varying intervalstrata tatand then more and
more regularly and rapidly and the action at the Goldbach Stream began

Not expecting to come on the enemy down by the stream and having
stumbled on him in the fog hearing no encouraging word from their
commanders and with a consciousness of being too late spreading through
the ranks and above all being unable to see anything in front or around
them in the thick fog the Russians exchanged shots with the enemy
lazily and advanced and again halted receiving no timely orders from
the officers or adjutants who wandered about in the fog in those unknown
surroundings unable to find their own regiments In this way the action
began for the first second and third columns which had gone down into
the valley The fourth column with which Kutzov was stood on the
Pratzen Heights

Below where the fight was beginning there was still thick fog on the
higher ground it was clearing but nothing could be seen of what was
going on in front Whether all the enemy forces were as we supposed
six miles away or whether they were near by in that sea of mist no one
knew till after eight oclock

It was nine oclock in the morning The fog lay unbroken like a sea down
below but higher up at the village of Schlappanitz where Napoleon stood
with his marshals around him it was quite light Above him was a clear
blue sky and the suns vast orb quivered like a huge hollow crimson
float on the surface of that milky sea of mist The whole French army
and even Napoleon himself with his staff were not on the far side of
the streams and hollows of Sokolnitz and Schlappanitz beyond which we
intended to take up our position and begin the action but were on this
side so close to our own forces that Napoleon with the naked eye could
distinguish a mounted man from one on foot Napoleon in the blue cloak
which he had worn on his Italian campaign sat on his small gray Arab
horse a little in front of his marshals He gazed silently at the hills
which seemed to rise out of the sea of mist and on which the Russian
troops were moving in the distance and he listened to the sounds of
firing in the valley Not a single muscle of his facewhich in those
days was still thinmoved His gleaming eyes were fixed intently on one
spot His predictions were being justified Part of the Russian force
had already descended into the valley toward the ponds and lakes and
part were leaving these Pratzen Heights which he intended to attack and
regarded as the key to the position He saw over the mist that in a
hollow between two hills near the village of Pratzen the Russian
columns their bayonets glittering were moving continuously in one
direction toward the valley and disappearing one after another into the
mist From information he had received the evening before from the
sound of wheels and footsteps heard by the outposts during the night by
the disorderly movement of the Russian columns and from all
indications he saw clearly that the allies believed him to be far away
in front of them and that the columns moving near Pratzen constituted
the center of the Russian army and that that center was already
sufficiently weakened to be successfully attacked But still he did not
begin the engagement

Today was a great day for himthe anniversary of his coronation Before
dawn he had slept for a few hours and refreshed vigorous and in good
spirits he mounted his horse and rode out into the field in that happy
mood in which everything seems possible and everything succeeds He sat
motionless looking at the heights visible above the mist and his cold
face wore that special look of confident selfcomplacent happiness that
one sees on the face of a boy happily in love The marshals stood behind
him not venturing to distract his attention He looked now at the
Pratzen Heights now at the sun floating up out of the mist

When the sun had entirely emerged from the fog and fields and mist were
aglow with dazzling lightas if he had only awaited this to begin the
actionhe drew the glove from his shapely white hand made a sign with
it to the marshals and ordered the action to begin The marshals
accompanied by adjutants galloped off in different directions and a
few minutes later the chief forces of the French army moved rapidly
toward those Pratzen Heights which were being more and more denuded by
Russian troops moving down the valley to their left





CHAPTER XV

At eight oclock Kutzov rode to Pratzen at the head of the fourth
column Miloradovichs the one that was to take the place of
Przebyszewskis and Langerons columns which had already gone down into
the valley He greeted the men of the foremost regiment and gave them
the order to march thereby indicating that he intended to lead that
column himself When he had reached the village of Pratzen he halted
Prince Andrew was behind among the immense number forming the
commanderinchiefs suite He was in a state of suppressed excitement
and irritation though controlledly calm as a man is at the approach of
a longawaited moment He was firmly convinced that this was the day of
his Toulon or his bridge of Arcola How it would come about he did not
know but he felt sure it would do so The locality and the position of
our troops were known to him as far as they could be known to anyone in
our army His own strategic plan which obviously could not now be
carried out was forgotten Now entering into Weyrothers plan Prince
Andrew considered possible contingencies and formed new projects such as
might call for his rapidity of perception and decision

To the left down below in the mist the musketry fire of unseen forces
could be heard It was there Prince Andrew thought the fight would
concentrate There we shall encounter difficulties and there thought
he I shall be sent with a brigade or division and there standard in
hand I shall go forward and break whatever is in front of me

He could not look calmly at the standards of the passing battalions
Seeing them he kept thinking That may be the very standard with which
I shall lead the army

In the morning all that was left of the night mist on the heights was a
hoar frost now turning to dew but in the valleys it still lay like a
milkwhite sea Nothing was visible in the valley to the left into which
our troops had descended and from whence came the sounds of firing
Above the heights was the dark clear sky and to the right the vast orb
of the sun In front far off on the farther shore of that sea of mist
some wooded hills were discernible and it was there the enemy probably
was for something could be descried On the right the Guards were
entering the misty region with a sound of hoofs and wheels and now and
then a gleam of bayonets to the left beyond the village similar masses
of cavalry came up and disappeared in the sea of mist In front and
behind moved infantry The commanderinchief was standing at the end of
the village letting the troops pass by him That morning Kutzov seemed
worn and irritable The infantry passing before him came to a halt
without any command being given apparently obstructed by something in
front

Do order them to form into battalion columns and go round the village
he said angrily to a general who had ridden up Dont you understand
your excellency my dear sir that you must not defile through narrow
village streets when we are marching against the enemy

I intended to reform them beyond the village your excellency
answered the general

Kutzov laughed bitterly

Youll make a fine thing of it deploying in sight of the enemy Very
fine

The enemy is still far away your excellency According to the
dispositions

The dispositions exclaimed Kutzov bitterly Who told you that
Kindly do as you are ordered

Yes sir

My dear fellow Nesvtski whispered to Prince Andrew the old man is
as surly as a dog

An Austrian officer in a white uniform with green plumes in his hat
galloped up to Kutzov and asked in the Emperors name had the fourth
column advanced into action

Kutzov turned round without answering and his eye happened to fall upon
Prince Andrew who was beside him Seeing him Kutzovs malevolent and
caustic expression softened as if admitting that what was being done
was not his adjutants fault and still not answering the Austrian
adjutant he addressed Bolknski

Go my dear fellow and see whether the third division has passed the
village Tell it to stop and await my orders

Hardly had Prince Andrew started than he stopped him

And ask whether sharpshooters have been posted he added What are
they doing What are they doing he murmured to himself still not
replying to the Austrian

Prince Andrew galloped off to execute the order

Overtaking the battalions that continued to advance he stopped the
third division and convinced himself that there really were no
sharpshooters in front of our columns The colonel at the head of the
regiment was much surprised at the commanderinchiefs order to throw
out skirmishers He had felt perfectly sure that there were other troops
in front of him and that the enemy must be at least six miles away
There was really nothing to be seen in front except a barren descent
hidden by dense mist Having given orders in the commanderinchiefs
name to rectify this omission Prince Andrew galloped back Kutzov
still in the same place his stout body resting heavily in the saddle
with the lassitude of age sat yawning wearily with closed eyes The
troops were no longer moving but stood with the butts of their muskets
on the ground

All right all right he said to Prince Andrew and turned to a
general who watch in hand was saying it was time they started as all
the leftflank columns had already descended

Plenty of time your excellency muttered Kutzov in the midst of a
yawn Plenty of time he repeated

Just then at a distance behind Kutzov was heard the sound of regiments
saluting and this sound rapidly came nearer along the whole extended
line of the advancing Russian columns Evidently the person they were
greeting was riding quickly When the soldiers of the regiment in front
of which Kutzov was standing began to shout he rode a little to one
side and looked round with a frown Along the road from Pratzen galloped
what looked like a squadron of horsemen in various uniforms Two of them
rode side by side in front at full gallop One in a black uniform with
white plumes in his hat rode a bobtailed chestnut horse the other who
was in a white uniform rode a black one These were the two Emperors
followed by their suites Kutzov affecting the manners of an old
soldier at the front gave the command Attention and rode up to the
Emperors with a salute His whole appearance and manner were suddenly
transformed He put on the air of a subordinate who obeys without
reasoning With an affectation of respect which evidently struck
Alexander unpleasantly he rode up and saluted

This unpleasant impression merely flitted over the young and happy face
of the Emperor like a cloud of haze across a clear sky and vanished
After his illness he looked rather thinner that day than on the field of
Olmutz where Bolknski had seen him for the first time abroad but there
was still the same bewitching combination of majesty and mildness in his
fine gray eyes and on his delicate lips the same capacity for varying
expression and the same prevalent appearance of goodhearted innocent
youth

At the Olmutz review he had seemed more majestic here he seemed
brighter and more energetic He was slightly flushed after galloping two
miles and reining in his horse he sighed restfully and looked round at
the faces of his suite young and animated as his own Czartoryski
Novosltsev Prince Volkonsky Strogonov and the others all richly
dressed gay young men on splendid wellgroomed fresh only slightly
heated horses exchanging remarks and smiling had stopped behind the
Emperor The Emperor Francis a rosy long faced young man sat very
erect on his handsome black horse looking about him in a leisurely and
preoccupied manner He beckoned to one of his white adjutants and asked
some questionMost likely he is asking at what oclock they started
thought Prince Andrew watching his old acquaintance with a smile he
could not repress as he recalled his reception at Brunn In the
Emperors suite were the picked young orderly officers of the Guard and
line regiments Russian and Austrian Among them were grooms leading the
Tsars beautiful relay horses covered with embroidered cloths

As when a window is opened a whiff of fresh air from the fields enters a
stuffy room so a whiff of youthfulness energy and confidence of
success reached Kutzovs cheerless staff with the galloping advent of
all these brilliant young men

Why arent you beginning Michael Ilarinovich said the Emperor
Alexander hurriedly to Kutzov glancing courteously at the same time at
the Emperor Francis

I am waiting Your Majesty answered Kutzov bending forward
respectfully

The Emperor frowning slightly bent his ear forward as if he had not
quite heard

Waiting Your Majesty repeated Kutzov Prince Andrew noted that
Kutzovs upper lip twitched unnaturally as he said the word waiting
Not all the columns have formed up yet Your Majesty

The Tsar heard but obviously did not like the reply he shrugged his
rather round shoulders and glanced at Novosltsev who was near him as
if complaining of Kutzov

You know Michael Ilarinovich we are not on the Empress Field where
a parade does not begin till all the troops are assembled said the
Tsar with another glance at the Emperor Francis as if inviting him if
not to join in at least to listen to what he was saying But the Emperor
Francis continued to look about him and did not listen

That is just why I do not begin sire said Kutzov in a resounding
voice apparently to preclude the possibility of not being heard and
again something in his face twitchedThat is just why I do not begin
sire because we are not on parade and not on the Empress Field said
clearly and distinctly

In the Emperors suite all exchanged rapid looks that expressed
dissatisfaction and reproach Old though he may be he should not he
certainly should not speak like that their glances seemed to say

The Tsar looked intently and observantly into Kutzovs eye waiting to
hear whether he would say anything more But Kutzov with respectfully
bowed head seemed also to be waiting The silence lasted for about a
minute

However if you command it Your Majesty said Kutzov lifting his
head and again assuming his former tone of a dull unreasoning but
submissive general

He touched his horse and having called Miloradovich the commander of
the column gave him the order to advance

The troops again began to move and two battalions of the Novgorod and
one of the Apsheron regiment went forward past the Emperor

As this Apsheron battalion marched by the redfaced Miloradovich
without his greatcoat with his Orders on his breast and an enormous
tuft of plumes in his cocked hat worn on one side with its corners front
and back galloped strenuously forward and with a dashing salute reined
in his horse before the Emperor

God be with you general said the Emperor

Ma foi sire nous ferons ce qui sera dans notre possibilite sire
he answered gaily raising nevertheless ironic smiles among the
gentlemen of the Tsars suite by his poor French

 Indeed Sire we shall do everything it is possible to do Sire

Miloradovich wheeled his horse sharply and stationed himself a little
behind the Emperor The Apsheron men excited by the Tsars presence
passed in step before the Emperors and their suites at a bold brisk
pace

Lads shouted Miloradovich in a loud selfconfident and cheery
voice obviously so elated by the sound of firing by the prospect of
battle and by the sight of the gallant Apsherons his comrades in
Suvrovs time now passing so gallantly before the Emperors that he
forgot the sovereigns presence Lads its not the first village
youve had to take cried he

Glad to do our best shouted the soldiers

The Emperors horse started at the sudden cry This horse that had
carried the sovereign at reviews in Russia bore him also here on the
field of Austerlitz enduring the heedless blows of his left foot and
pricking its ears at the sound of shots just as it had done on the
Empress Field not understanding the significance of the firing nor of
the nearness of the Emperor Francis black cob nor of all that was
being said thought and felt that day by its rider

The Emperor turned with a smile to one of his followers and made a
remark to him pointing to the gallant Apsherons





CHAPTER XVI

Kutzov accompanied by his adjutants rode at a walking pace behind the
carabineers

When he had gone less than half a mile in the rear of the column he
stopped at a solitary deserted house that had probably once been an
inn where two roads parted Both of them led downhill and troops were
marching along both

The fog had begun to clear and enemy troops were already dimly visible
about a mile and a half off on the opposite heights Down below on the
left the firing became more distinct Kutzov had stopped and was
speaking to an Austrian general Prince Andrew who was a little behind
looking at them turned to an adjutant to ask him for a field glass

Look look said this adjutant looking not at the troops in the
distance but down the hill before him Its the French

The two generals and the adjutant took hold of the field glass trying
to snatch it from one another The expression on all their faces
suddenly changed to one of horror The French were supposed to be a mile
and a half away but had suddenly and unexpectedly appeared just in
front of us

Its the enemy No Yes see it is for certain But how is
that said different voices

With the naked eye Prince Andrew saw below them to the right not more
than five hundred paces from where Kutzov was standing a dense French
column coming up to meet the Apsherons

Here it is The decisive moment has arrived My turn has come thought
Prince Andrew and striking his horse he rode up to Kutzov

The Apsherons must be stopped your excellency cried he But at that
very instant a cloud of smoke spread all round firing was heard quite
close at hand and a voice of nave terror barely two steps from Prince
Andrew shouted Brothers Alls lost And at this as if at a command
everyone began to run

Confused and everincreasing crowds were running back to where five
minutes before the troops had passed the Emperors Not only would it
have been difficult to stop that crowd it was even impossible not to be
carried back with it oneself Bolknski only tried not to lose touch
with it and looked around bewildered and unable to grasp what was
happening in front of him Nesvtski with an angry face red and unlike
himself was shouting to Kutzov that if he did not ride away at once he
would certainly be taken prisoner Kutzov remained in the same place
and without answering drew out a handkerchief Blood was flowing from
his cheek Prince Andrew forced his way to him

You are wounded he asked hardly able to master the trembling of his
lower jaw

The wound is not here it is there said Kutzov pressing the
handkerchief to his wounded cheek and pointing to the fleeing soldiers
Stop them he shouted and at the same moment probably realizing that
it was impossible to stop them spurred his horse and rode to the right

A fresh wave of the flying mob caught him and bore him back with it

The troops were running in such a dense mass that once surrounded by
them it was difficult to get out again One was shouting Get on Why
are you hindering us Another in the same place turned round and fired
in the air a third was striking the horse Kutzov himself rode Having
by a great effort got away to the left from that flood of men Kutzov
with his suite diminished by more than half rode toward a sound of
artillery fire near by Having forced his way out of the crowd of
fugitives Prince Andrew trying to keep near Kutzov saw on the slope
of the hill amid the smoke a Russian battery that was still firing and
Frenchmen running toward it Higher up stood some Russian infantry
neither moving forward to protect the battery nor backward with the
fleeing crowd A mounted general separated himself from the infantry and
approached Kutzov Of Kutzovs suite only four remained They were all
pale and exchanged looks in silence

Stop those wretches gasped Kutzov to the regimental commander
pointing to the flying soldiers but at that instant as if to punish
him for those words bullets flew hissing across the regiment and across
Kutzovs suite like a flock of little birds

The French had attacked the battery and seeing Kutzov were firing at
him After this volley the regimental commander clutched at his leg
several soldiers fell and a second lieutenant who was holding the flag
let it fall from his hands It swayed and fell but caught on the
muskets of the nearest soldiers The soldiers started firing without
orders

Oh Oh Oh groaned Kutzov despairingly and looked around
Bolknski he whispered his voice trembling from a consciousness of
the feebleness of age Bolknski he whispered pointing to the
disordered battalion and at the enemy whats that

But before he had finished speaking Prince Andrew feeling tears of
shame and anger choking him had already leapt from his horse and run to
the standard

Forward lads he shouted in a voice piercing as a childs

Here it is thought he seizing the staff of the standard and hearing
with pleasure the whistle of bullets evidently aimed at him Several
soldiers fell

Hurrah shouted Prince Andrew and scarcely able to hold up the heavy
standard he ran forward with full confidence that the whole battalion
would follow him

And really he only ran a few steps alone One soldier moved and then
another and soon the whole battalion ran forward shouting Hurrah and
overtook him A sergeant of the battalion ran up and took the flag that
was swaying from its weight in Prince Andrews hands but he was
immediately killed Prince Andrew again seized the standard and
dragging it by the staff ran on with the battalion In front he saw our
artillerymen some of whom were fighting while others having abandoned
their guns were running toward him He also saw French infantry
soldiers who were seizing the artillery horses and turning the guns
round Prince Andrew and the battalion were already within twenty paces
of the cannon He heard the whistle of bullets above him unceasingly and
to right and left of him soldiers continually groaned and dropped But
he did not look at them he looked only at what was going on in front of
himat the battery He now saw clearly the figure of a redhaired gunner
with his shako knocked awry pulling one end of a mop while a French
soldier tugged at the other He could distinctly see the distraught yet
angry expression on the faces of these two men who evidently did not
realize what they were doing

What are they about thought Prince Andrew as he gazed at them Why
doesnt the redhaired gunner run away as he is unarmed Why doesnt the
Frenchman stab him He will not get away before the Frenchman remembers
his bayonet and stabs him

And really another French soldier trailing his musket ran up to the
struggling men and the fate of the redhaired gunner who had
triumphantly secured the mop and still did not realize what awaited him
was about to be decided But Prince Andrew did not see how it ended It
seemed to him as though one of the soldiers near him hit him on the head
with the full swing of a bludgeon It hurt a little but the worst of it
was that the pain distracted him and prevented his seeing what he had
been looking at

Whats this Am I falling My legs are giving way thought he and
fell on his back He opened his eyes hoping to see how the struggle of
the Frenchmen with the gunners ended whether the redhaired gunner had
been killed or not and whether the cannon had been captured or saved
But he saw nothing Above him there was now nothing but the skythe
lofty sky not clear yet still immeasurably lofty with gray clouds
gliding slowly across it How quiet peaceful and solemn not at all
as I ran thought Prince Andrewnot as we ran shouting and fighting
not at all as the gunner and the Frenchman with frightened and angry
faces struggled for the mop how differently do those clouds glide
across that lofty infinite sky How was it I did not see that lofty sky
before And how happy I am to have found it at last Yes All is vanity
all falsehood except that infinite sky There is nothing nothing but
that But even it does not exist there is nothing but quiet and peace
Thank God





CHAPTER XVII

On our right flank commanded by Bagration at nine oclock the battle
had not yet begun Not wishing to agree to Dolgorukovs demand to
commence the action and wishing to avert responsibility from himself
Prince Bagration proposed to Dolgorukov to send to inquire of the
commanderinchief Bagration knew that as the distance between the two
flanks was more than six miles even if the messenger were not killed
which he very likely would be and found the commanderinchief which
would be very difficult he would not be able to get back before
evening

Bagration cast his large expressionless sleepy eyes round his suite
and the boyish face Rostv breathless with excitement and hope was the
first to catch his eye He sent him

And if I should meet His Majesty before I meet the commanderinchief
your excellency said Rostv with his hand to his cap

You can give the message to His Majesty said Dolgorukov hurriedly
interrupting Bagration

On being relieved from picket duty Rostv had managed to get a few
hours sleep before morning and felt cheerful bold and resolute with
elasticity of movement faith in his good fortune and generally in that
state of mind which makes everything seem possible pleasant and easy

All his wishes were being fulfilled that morning there was to be a
general engagement in which he was taking part more than that he was
orderly to the bravest general and still more he was going with a
message to Kutzov perhaps even to the sovereign himself The morning
was bright he had a good horse under him and his heart was full of joy
and happiness On receiving the order he gave his horse the rein and
galloped along the line At first he rode along the line of Bagrations
troops which had not yet advanced into action but were standing
motionless then he came to the region occupied by Uvarovs cavalry and
here he noticed a stir and signs of preparation for battle having
passed Uvarovs cavalry he clearly heard the sound of cannon and
musketry ahead of him The firing grew louder and louder

In the fresh morning air were now heard not two or three musket shots
at irregular intervals as before followed by one or two cannon shots
but a roll of volleys of musketry from the slopes of the hill before
Pratzen interrupted by such frequent reports of cannon that sometimes
several of them were not separated from one another but merged into a
general roar

He could see puffs of musketry smoke that seemed to chase one another
down the hillsides and clouds of cannon smoke rolling spreading and
mingling with one another He could also by the gleam of bayonets
visible through the smoke make out moving masses of infantry and narrow
lines of artillery with green caissons

Rostv stopped his horse for a moment on a hillock to see what was going
on but strain his attention as he would he could not understand or make
out anything of what was happening there in the smoke men of some sort
were moving about in front and behind moved lines of troops but why
whither and who they were it was impossible to make out These sights
and sounds had no depressing or intimidating effect on him on the
contrary they stimulated his energy and determination

Go on Go on Give it them he mentally exclaimed at these sounds and
again proceeded to gallop along the line penetrating farther and
farther into the region where the army was already in action

How it will be there I dont know but all will be well thought
Rostv

After passing some Austrian troops he noticed that the next part of the
line the Guards was already in action

So much the better I shall see it close he thought

He was riding almost along the front line A handful of men came
galloping toward him They were our uhlans who with disordered ranks
were returning from the attack Rostv got out of their way
involuntarily noticed that one of them was bleeding and galloped on

That is no business of mine he thought He had not ridden many
hundred yards after that before he saw to his left across the whole
width of the field an enormous mass of cavalry in brilliant white
uniforms mounted on black horses trotting straight toward him and
across his path Rostv put his horse to full gallop to get out of the
way of these men and he would have got clear had they continued at the
same speed but they kept increasing their pace so that some of the
horses were already galloping Rostv heard the thud of their hoofs and
the jingle of their weapons and saw their horses their figures and
even their faces more and more distinctly They were our Horse Guards
advancing to attack the French cavalry that was coming to meet them

The Horse Guards were galloping but still holding in their horses
Rostv could already see their faces and heard the command Charge
shouted by an officer who was urging his thoroughbred to full speed
Rostv fearing to be crushed or swept into the attack on the French
galloped along the front as hard as his horse could go but still was
not in time to avoid them

The last of the Horse Guards a huge pockmarked fellow frowned angrily
on seeing Rostv before him with whom he would inevitably collide This
Guardsman would certainly have bowled Rostv and his Bedouin over
Rostv felt himself quite tiny and weak compared to these gigantic men
and horses had it not occurred to Rostv to flourish his whip before
the eyes of the Guardsmans horse The heavy black horse sixteen hands
high shied throwing back its ears but the pockmarked Guardsman drove
his huge spurs in violently and the horse flourishing its tail and
extending its neck galloped on yet faster Hardly had the Horse Guards
passed Rostv before he heard them shout Hurrah and looking back saw
that their foremost ranks were mixed up with some foreign cavalry with
red epaulets probably French He could see nothing more for
immediately afterwards cannon began firing from somewhere and smoke
enveloped everything

At that moment as the Horse Guards having passed him disappeared in
the smoke Rostv hesitated whether to gallop after them or to go where
he was sent This was the brilliant charge of the Horse Guards that
amazed the French themselves Rostv was horrified to hear later that of
all that mass of huge and handsome men of all those brilliant rich
youths officers and cadets who had galloped past him on their
thousandruble horses only eighteen were left after the charge

Why should I envy them My chance is not lost and maybe I shall see
the Emperor immediately thought Rostv and galloped on

When he came level with the Foot Guards he noticed that about them and
around them cannon balls were flying of which he was aware not so much
because he heard their sound as because he saw uneasiness on the
soldiers faces and unnatural warlike solemnity on those of the
officers

Passing behind one of the lines of a regiment of Foot Guards he heard a
voice calling him by name

Rostv

What he answered not recognizing Bors

I say weve been in the front line Our regiment attacked said Bors
with the happy smile seen on the faces of young men who have been under
fire for the first time

Rostv stopped

Have you he said Well how did it go

We drove them back said Bors with animation growing talkative Can
you imagine it and he began describing how the Guards having taken up
their position and seeing troops before them thought they were
Austrians and all at once discovered from the cannon balls discharged
by those troops that they were themselves in the front line and had
unexpectedly to go into action Rostv without hearing Bors to the end
spurred his horse

Where are you off to asked Bors

With a message to His Majesty

There he is said Bors thinking Rostv had said His Highness and
pointing to the Grand Duke who with his high shoulders and frowning
brows stood a hundred paces away from them in his helmet and Horse
Guards jacket shouting something to a pale white uniformed Austrian
officer

But thats the Grand Duke and I want the commanderinchief or the
Emperor said Rostv and was about to spur his horse

Count Count shouted Berg who ran up from the other side as eager as
Bors Count I am wounded in my right hand and he showed his
bleeding hand with a handkerchief tied round it and I remained at the
front I held my sword in my left hand Count All our familythe von
Bergshave been knights

He said something more but Rostv did not wait to hear it and rode
away

Having passed the Guards and traversed an empty space Rostv to avoid
again getting in front of the first line as he had done when the Horse
Guards charged followed the line of reserves going far round the place
where the hottest musket fire and cannonade were heard Suddenly he
heard musket fire quite close in front of him and behind our troops
where he could never have expected the enemy to be

What can it be he thought The enemy in the rear of our army
Impossible And suddenly he was seized by a panic of fear for himself
and for the issue of the whole battle But be that what it may he
reflected there is no riding round it now I must look for the
commander in chief here and if all is lost it is for me to perish with
the rest

The foreboding of evil that had suddenly come over Rostv was more and
more confirmed the farther he rode into the region behind the village of
Pratzen which was full of troops of all kinds

What does it mean What is it Whom are they firing at Who is firing
Rostv kept asking as he came up to Russian and Austrian soldiers
running in confused crowds across his path

The devil knows Theyve killed everybody Its all up now he was
told in Russian German and Czech by the crowd of fugitives who
understood what was happening as little as he did

Kill the Germans shouted one

May the devil take themthe traitors

Zum Henker diese Russen muttered a German

 Hang these Russians

Several wounded men passed along the road and words of abuse screams
and groans mingled in a general hubbub then the firing died down
Rostv learned later that Russian and Austrian soldiers had been firing
at one another

My God What does it all mean thought he And here where at any
moment the Emperor may see them But no these must be only a handful
of scoundrels It will soon be over it cant be that it cant be Only
to get past them quicker quicker

The idea of defeat and flight could not enter Rostvs head Though he
saw French cannon and French troops on the Pratzen Heights just where he
had been ordered to look for the commanderinchief he could not did
not wish to believe that





CHAPTER XVIII

Rostv had been ordered to look for Kutzov and the Emperor near the
village of Pratzen But neither they nor a single commanding officer
were there only disorganized crowds of troops of various kinds He
urged on his already weary horse to get quickly past these crowds but
the farther he went the more disorganized they were The highroad on
which he had come out was thronged with calches carriages of all
sorts and Russian and Austrian soldiers of all arms some wounded and
some not This whole mass droned and jostled in confusion under the
dismal influence of cannon balls flying from the French batteries
stationed on the Pratzen Heights

Where is the Emperor Where is Kutzov Rostv kept asking everyone he
could stop but got no answer from anyone

At last seizing a soldier by his collar he forced him to answer

Eh brother Theyve all bolted long ago said the soldier laughing
for some reason and shaking himself free

Having left that soldier who was evidently drunk Rostv stopped the
horse of a batman or groom of some important personage and began to
question him The man announced that the Tsar had been driven in a
carriage at full speed about an hour before along that very road and
that he was dangerously wounded

It cant be said Rostv It must have been someone else

I saw him myself replied the man with a selfconfident smile of
derision I ought to know the Emperor by now after the times Ive seen
him in Petersburg I saw him just as I see you There he sat in the
carriage as pale as anything How they made the four black horses fly
Gracious me they did rattle past Its time I knew the Imperial horses
and Ily Ivanych I dont think Ily drives anyone except the Tsar

Rostv let go of the horse and was about to ride on when a wounded
officer passing by addressed him

Who is it you want he asked The commanderinchief He was killed
by a cannon ballstruck in the breast before our regiment

Not killedwounded another officer corrected him

Who Kutzov asked Rostv

Not Kutzov but whats his namewell never mind there are not many
left alive Go that way to that village all the commanders are there
said the officer pointing to the village of Hosjeradek and he walked
on

Rostv rode on at a footpace not knowing why or to whom he was now
going The Emperor was wounded the battle lost It was impossible to
doubt it now Rostv rode in the direction pointed out to him in which
he saw turrets and a church What need to hurry What was he now to say
to the Tsar or to Kutzov even if they were alive and unwounded

Take this road your honor that way you will be killed at once a
soldier shouted to him Theyd kill you there

Oh what are you talking about said another Where is he to go That
way is nearer

Rostv considered and then went in the direction where they said he
would be killed

Its all the same now If the Emperor is wounded am I to try to save
myself he thought He rode on to the region where the greatest number
of men had perished in fleeing from Pratzen The French had not yet
occupied that region and the Russiansthe uninjured and slightly
woundedhad left it long ago All about the field like heaps of manure
on wellkept plowland lay from ten to fifteen dead and wounded to each
couple of acres The wounded crept together in twos and threes and one
could hear their distressing screams and groans sometimes feignedor so
it seemed to Rostv He put his horse to a trot to avoid seeing all
these suffering men and he felt afraidafraid not for his life but for
the courage he needed and which he knew would not stand the sight of
these unfortunates

The French who had ceased firing at this field strewn with dead and
wounded where there was no one left to fire at on seeing an adjutant
riding over it trained a gun on him and fired several shots The
sensation of those terrible whistling sounds and of the corpses around
him merged in Rostvs mind into a single feeling of terror and pity for
himself He remembered his mothers last letter What would she feel
thought he if she saw me here now on this field with the cannon aimed
at me

In the village of Hosjeradek there were Russian troops retiring from the
field of battle who though still in some confusion were less
disordered The French cannon did not reach there and the musketry fire
sounded far away Here everyone clearly saw and said that the battle was
lost No one whom Rostv asked could tell him where the Emperor or
Kutzov was Some said the report that the Emperor was wounded was
correct others that it was not and explained the false rumor that had
spread by the fact that the Emperors carriage had really galloped from
the field of battle with the pale and terrified OberHofmarschal Count
Tolsty who had ridden out to the battlefield with others in the
Emperors suite One officer told Rostv that he had seen someone from
headquarters behind the village to the left and thither Rostv rode
not hoping to find anyone but merely to ease his conscience When he had
ridden about two miles and had passed the last of the Russian troops he
saw near a kitchen garden with a ditch round it two men on horseback
facing the ditch One with a white plume in his hat seemed familiar to
Rostv the other on a beautiful chestnut horse which Rostv fancied he
had seen before rode up to the ditch struck his horse with his spurs
and giving it the rein leaped lightly over Only a little earth crumbled
from the bank under the horses hind hoofs Turning the horse sharply
he again jumped the ditch and deferentially addressed the horseman with
the white plumes evidently suggesting that he should do the same The
rider whose figure seemed familiar to Rostv and involuntarily riveted
his attention made a gesture of refusal with his head and hand and by
that gesture Rostv instantly recognized his lamented and adored
monarch

But it cant be he alone in the midst of this empty field thought
Rostv At that moment Alexander turned his head and Rostv saw the
beloved features that were so deeply engraved on his memory The Emperor
was pale his cheeks sunken and his eyes hollow but the charm the
mildness of his features was all the greater Rostv was happy in the
assurance that the rumors about the Emperor being wounded were false He
was happy to be seeing him He knew that he might and even ought to go
straight to him and give the message Dolgorukov had ordered him to
deliver

But as a youth in love trembles is unnerved and dares not utter the
thoughts he has dreamed of for nights but looks around for help or a
chance of delay and flight when the longedfor moment comes and he is
alone with her so Rostv now that he had attained what he had longed
for more than anything else in the world did not know how to approach
the Emperor and a thousand reasons occurred to him why it would be
inconvenient unseemly and impossible to do so

What It is as if I were glad of a chance to take advantage of his
being alone and despondent A strange face may seem unpleasant or
painful to him at this moment of sorrow besides what can I say to him
now when my heart fails me and my mouth feels dry at the mere sight of
him Not one of the innumerable speeches addressed to the Emperor that
he had composed in his imagination could he now recall Those speeches
were intended for quite other conditions they were for the most part to
be spoken at a moment of victory and triumph generally when he was
dying of wounds and the sovereign had thanked him for heroic deeds and
while dying he expressed the love his actions had proved

Besides how can I ask the Emperor for his instructions for the right
flank now that it is nearly four oclock and the battle is lost No
certainly I must not approach him I must not intrude on his
reflections Better die a thousand times than risk receiving an unkind
look or bad opinion from him Rostv decided and sorrowfully and with
a heart full despair he rode away continually looking back at the Tsar
who still remained in the same attitude of indecision

While Rostv was thus arguing with himself and riding sadly away
Captain von Toll chanced to ride to the same spot and seeing the
Emperor at once rode up to him offered his services and assisted him
to cross the ditch on foot The Emperor wishing to rest and feeling
unwell sat down under an apple tree and von Toll remained beside him
Rostv from a distance saw with envy and remorse how von Toll spoke long
and warmly to the Emperor and how the Emperor evidently weeping
covered his eyes with his hand and pressed von Tolls hand

And I might have been in his place thought Rostv and hardly
restraining his tears of pity for the Emperor he rode on in utter
despair not knowing where to or why he was now riding

His despair was all the greater from feeling that his own weakness was
the cause of his grief

He might not only might but should have gone up to the sovereign It
was a unique chance to show his devotion to the Emperor and he had not
made use of it What have I done thought he And he turned round
and galloped back to the place where he had seen the Emperor but there
was no one beyond the ditch now Only some carts and carriages were
passing by From one of the drivers he learned that Kutzovs staff were
not far off in the village the vehicles were going to Rostv followed
them In front of him walked Kutzovs groom leading horses in
horsecloths Then came a cart and behind that walked an old bandy
legged domestic serf in a peaked cap and sheepskin coat

Tit I say Tit said the groom

What answered the old man absentmindedly

Go Tit Thresh a bit

Oh you fool said the old man spitting angrily Some time passed in
silence and then the same joke was repeated

Before five in the evening the battle had been lost at all points More
than a hundred cannon were already in the hands of the French

Przebyszewski and his corps had laid down their arms Other columns
after losing half their men were retreating in disorderly confused
masses

The remains of Langerons and Dokhturovs mingled forces were crowding
around the dams and banks of the ponds near the village of Augesd

After five oclock it was only at the Augesd Dam that a hot cannonade
delivered by the French alone was still to be heard from numerous
batteries ranged on the slopes of the Pratzen Heights directed at our
retreating forces

In the rearguard Dokhturov and others rallying some battalions kept up
a musketry fire at the French cavalry that was pursuing our troops It
was growing dusk On the narrow Augesd Dam where for so many years the
old miller had been accustomed to sit in his tasseled cap peacefully
angling while his grandson with shirt sleeves rolled up handled the
floundering silvery fish in the watering can on that dam over which for
so many years Moravians in shaggy caps and blue jackets had peacefully
driven their twohorse carts loaded with wheat and had returned dusty
with flour whitening their cartson that narrow dam amid the wagons and
the cannon under the horses hoofs and between the wagon wheels men
disfigured by fear of death now crowded together crushing one another
dying stepping over the dying and killing one another only to move on
a few steps and be killed themselves in the same way

Every ten seconds a cannon ball flew compressing the air around or a
shell burst in the midst of that dense throng killing some and
splashing with blood those near them

Dlokhovnow an officerwounded in the arm and on foot with the
regimental commander on horseback and some ten men of his company
represented all that was left of that whole regiment Impelled by the
crowd they had got wedged in at the approach to the dam and jammed in
on all sides had stopped because a horse in front had fallen under a
cannon and the crowd were dragging it out A cannon ball killed someone
behind them another fell in front and splashed Dlokhov with blood The
crowd pushing forward desperately squeezed together moved a few
steps and again stopped

Move on a hundred yards and we are certainly saved remain here another
two minutes and it is certain death thought each one

Dlokhov who was in the midst of the crowd forced his way to the edge of
the dam throwing two soldiers off their feet and ran onto the slippery
ice that covered the millpool

Turn this way he shouted jumping over the ice which creaked under
him turn this way he shouted to those with the gun It bears

The ice bore him but it swayed and creaked and it was plain that it
would give way not only under a cannon or a crowd but very soon even
under his weight alone The men looked at him and pressed to the bank
hesitating to step onto the ice The general on horseback at the
entrance to the dam raised his hand and opened his mouth to address
Dlokhov Suddenly a cannon ball hissed so low above the crowd that
everyone ducked It flopped into something moist and the general fell
from his horse in a pool of blood Nobody gave him a look or thought of
raising him

Get onto the ice over the ice Go on Turn Dont you hear Go on
innumerable voices suddenly shouted after the ball had struck the
general the men themselves not knowing what or why they were
shouting

One of the hindmost guns that was going onto the dam turned off onto the
ice Crowds of soldiers from the dam began running onto the frozen pond
The ice gave way under one of the foremost soldiers and one leg slipped
into the water He tried to right himself but fell in up to his waist
The nearest soldiers shrank back the gun driver stopped his horse but
from behind still came the shouts Onto the ice why do you stop Go
on Go on And cries of horror were heard in the crowd The soldiers
near the gun waved their arms and beat the horses to make them turn and
move on The horses moved off the bank The ice that had held under
those on foot collapsed in a great mass and some forty men who were on
it dashed some forward and some back drowning one another

Still the cannon balls continued regularly to whistle and flop onto the
ice and into the water and oftenest of all among the crowd that covered
the dam the pond and the bank





CHAPTER XIX

On the Pratzen Heights where he had fallen with the flagstaff in his
hand lay Prince Andrew Bolknski bleeding profusely and unconsciously
uttering a gentle piteous and childlike moan

Toward evening he ceased moaning and became quite still He did not know
how long his unconsciousness lasted Suddenly he again felt that he was
alive and suffering from a burning lacerating pain in his head

Where is it that lofty sky that I did not know till now but saw
today was his first thought And I did not know this suffering
either he thought Yes I did not know anything anything at all till
now But where am I

He listened and heard the sound of approaching horses and voices
speaking French He opened his eyes Above him again was the same lofty
sky with clouds that had risen and were floating still higher and
between them gleamed blue infinity He did not turn his head and did not
see those who judging by the sound of hoofs and voices had ridden up
and stopped near him

It was Napoleon accompanied by two aidesdecamp Bonaparte riding over
the battlefield had given final orders to strengthen the batteries
firing at the Augesd Dam and was looking at the killed and wounded left
on the field

Fine men remarked Napoleon looking at a dead Russian grenadier who
with his face buried in the ground and a blackened nape lay on his
stomach with an already stiffened arm flung wide

The ammunition for the guns in position is exhausted Your Majesty
said an adjutant who had come from the batteries that were firing at
Augesd

Have some brought from the reserve said Napoleon and having gone on
a few steps he stopped before Prince Andrew who lay on his back with
the flagstaff that had been dropped beside him The flag had already
been taken by the French as a trophy

Thats a fine death said Napoleon as he gazed at Bolknski

Prince Andrew understood that this was said of him and that it was
Napoleon who said it He heard the speaker addressed as Sire But he
heard the words as he might have heard the buzzing of a fly Not only
did they not interest him but he took no notice of them and at once
forgot them His head was burning he felt himself bleeding to death
and he saw above him the remote lofty and everlasting sky He knew it
was Napoleonhis herobut at that moment Napoleon seemed to him such a
small insignificant creature compared with what was passing now between
himself and that lofty infinite sky with the clouds flying over it At
that moment it meant nothing to him who might be standing over him or
what was said of him he was only glad that people were standing near
him and only wished that they would help him and bring him back to life
which seemed to him so beautiful now that he had today learned to
understand it so differently He collected all his strength to stir and
utter a sound He feebly moved his leg and uttered a weak sickly groan
which aroused his own pity

Ah He is alive said Napoleon Lift this young man up and carry him
to the dressing station

Having said this Napoleon rode on to meet Marshal Lannes who hat in
hand rode up smiling to the Emperor to congratulate him on the victory

Prince Andrew remembered nothing more he lost consciousness from the
terrible pain of being lifted onto the stretcher the jolting while
being moved and the probing of his wound at the dressing station He
did not regain consciousness till late in the day when with other
wounded and captured Russian officers he was carried to the hospital
During this transfer he felt a little stronger and was able to look
about him and even speak

The first words he heard on coming to his senses were those of a French
convoy officer who said rapidly We must halt here the Emperor will
pass here immediately it will please him to see these gentlemen
prisoners

There are so many prisoners today nearly the whole Russian army that
he is probably tired of them said another officer

All the same They say this one is the commander of all the Emperor
Alexanders Guards said the first one indicating a Russian officer in
the white uniform of the Horse Guards

Bolknski recognized Prince Repnin whom he had met in Petersburg
society Beside him stood a lad of nineteen also a wounded officer of
the Horse Guards

Bonaparte having come up at a gallop stopped his horse

Which is the senior he asked on seeing the prisoners

They named the colonel Prince Repnin

You are the commander of the Emperor Alexanders regiment of Horse
Guards asked Napoleon

I commanded a squadron replied Repnin

Your regiment fulfilled its duty honorably said Napoleon

The praise of a great commander is a soldiers highest reward said
Repnin

I bestow it with pleasure said Napoleon And who is that young man
beside you

Prince Repnin named Lieutenant Sukhtelen

After looking at him Napoleon smiled

Hes very young to come to meddle with us

Youth is no hindrance to courage muttered Sukhtelen in a failing
voice

A splendid reply said Napoleon Young man you will go far

Prince Andrew who had also been brought forward before the Emperors
eyes to complete the show of prisoners could not fail to attract his
attention Napoleon apparently remembered seeing him on the battlefield
and addressing him again used the epithet young man that was
connected in his memory with Prince Andrew

Well and you young man said he How do you feel mon brave

Though five minutes before Prince Andrew had been able to say a few
words to the soldiers who were carrying him now with his eyes fixed
straight on Napoleon he was silent So insignificant at that moment
seemed to him all the interests that engrossed Napoleon so mean did his
hero himself with his paltry vanity and joy in victory appear compared
to the lofty equitable and kindly sky which he had seen and
understood that he could not answer him

Everything seemed so futile and insignificant in comparison with the
stern and solemn train of thought that weakness from loss of blood
suffering and the nearness of death aroused in him Looking into
Napoleons eyes Prince Andrew thought of the insignificance of
greatness the unimportance of life which no one could understand and
the still greater unimportance of death the meaning of which no one
alive could understand or explain

The Emperor without waiting for an answer turned away and said to one of
the officers as he went Have these gentlemen attended to and taken to
my bivouac let my doctor Larrey examine their wounds Au revoir
Prince Repnin and he spurred his horse and galloped away

His face shone with selfsatisfaction and pleasure

The soldiers who had carried Prince Andrew had noticed and taken the
little gold icon Princess Mary had hung round her brothers neck but
seeing the favor the Emperor showed the prisoners they now hastened to
return the holy image

Prince Andrew did not see how and by whom it was replaced but the
little icon with its thin gold chain suddenly appeared upon his chest
outside his uniform

It would be good thought Prince Andrew glancing at the icon his
sister had hung round his neck with such emotion and reverence it
would be good if everything were as clear and simple as it seems to
Mary How good it would be to know where to seek for help in this life
and what to expect after it beyond the grave How happy and calm I
should be if I could now say Lord have mercy on me But to whom
should I say that Either to a Power indefinable incomprehensible
which I not only cannot address but which I cannot even express in
wordsthe Great All or Nothing said he to himself or to that God who
has been sewn into this amulet by Mary There is nothing certain
nothing at all except the unimportance of everything I understand and
the greatness of something incomprehensible but allimportant

The stretchers moved on At every jolt he again felt unendurable pain
his feverishness increased and he grew delirious Visions of his father
wife sister and future son and the tenderness he had felt the night
before the battle the figure of the insignificant little Napoleon and
above all this the lofty sky formed the chief subjects of his delirious
fancies

The quiet home life and peaceful happiness of Bald Hills presented
itself to him He was already enjoying that happiness when that little
Napoleon had suddenly appeared with his unsympathizing look of
shortsighted delight at the misery of others and doubts and torments
had followed and only the heavens promised peace Toward morning all
these dreams melted and merged into the chaos and darkness of
unconciousness and oblivion which in the opinion of Napoleons doctor
Larrey was much more likely to end in death than in convalescence

He is a nervous bilious subject said Larrey and will not recover

And Prince Andrew with others fatally wounded was left to the care of
the inhabitants of the district





BOOK FOUR 1806





CHAPTER I

Early in the year 1806 Nicholas Rostv returned home on leave Denisov
was going home to Voronezh and Rostv persuaded him to travel with him
as far as Moscow and to stay with him there Meeting a comrade at the
last post station but one before Moscow Denisov had drunk three bottles
of wine with him and despite the jolting ruts across the snowcovered
road did not once wake up on the way to Moscow but lay at the bottom
of the sleigh beside Rostv who grew more and more impatient the nearer
they got to Moscow

How much longer How much longer Oh these insufferable streets
shops bakers signboards street lamps and sleighs thought Rostv
when their leave permits had been passed at the town gate and they had
entered Moscow

Denisov Were here Hes asleep he added leaning forward with his
whole body as if in that position he hoped to hasten the speed of the
sleigh

Denisov gave no answer

Theres the corner at the crossroads where the cabman Zakhar has his
stand and theres Zakhar himself and still the same horse And heres
the little shop where we used to buy gingerbread Cant you hurry up
Now then

Which house is it asked the driver

Why that one right at the end the big one Dont you see Thats our
house said Rostv Of course its our house Denisov Denisov Were
almost there

Denisov raised his head coughed and made no answer

Dmtri said Rostv to his valet on the box those lights are in our
house arent they

Yes sir and theres a light in your fathers study

Then theyve not gone to bed yet What do you think Mind now dont
forget to put out my new coat added Rostv fingering his new
mustache Now then get on he shouted to the driver Do wake up
Vaska he went on turning to Denisov whose head was again nodding
Come get on You shall have three rubles for vodkaget on Rostv
shouted when the sleigh was only three houses from his door It seemed
to him the horses were not moving at all At last the sleigh bore to the
right drew up at an entrance and Rostv saw overhead the old familiar
cornice with a bit of plaster broken off the porch and the post by the
side of the pavement He sprang out before the sleigh stopped and ran
into the hall The house stood cold and silent as if quite regardless
of who had come to it There was no one in the hall Oh God Is
everyone all right he thought stopping for a moment with a sinking
heart and then immediately starting to run along the hall and up the
warped steps of the familiar staircase The wellknown old door handle
which always angered the countess when it was not properly cleaned
turned as loosely as ever A solitary tallow candle burned in the
anteroom

Old Michael was asleep on the chest Prokofy the footman who was so
strong that he could lift the back of the carriage from behind sat
plaiting slippers out of cloth selvedges He looked up at the opening
door and his expression of sleepy indifference suddenly changed to one
of delighted amazement

Gracious heavens The young count he cried recognizing his young
master Can it be My treasure and Prokofy trembling with
excitement rushed toward the drawing room door probably in order to
announce him but changing his mind came back and stooped to kiss the
young mans shoulder

All well asked Rostv drawing away his arm

Yes God be thanked Yes Theyve just finished supper Let me have a
look at you your excellency

Is everything quite all right

The Lord be thanked yes

Rostv who had completely forgotten Denisov not wishing anyone to
forestall him threw off his fur coat and ran on tiptoe through the
large dark ballroom All was the same there were the same old card
tables and the same chandelier with a cover over it but someone had
already seen the young master and before he had reached the drawing
room something flew out from a side door like a tornado and began
hugging and kissing him Another and yet another creature of the same
kind sprang from a second door and a third more hugging more kissing
more outcries and tears of joy He could not distinguish which was
Papa which Natsha and which Ptya Everyone shouted talked and
kissed him at the same time Only his mother was not there he noticed
that

And I did not know Nicholas My darling

Here he is our own Kolya dear fellow How he has changed
Where are the candles Tea

 Nicholas

And me kiss me

Dearest and me

Snya Natsha Ptya Anna Mikhylovna Vra and the old count were
all hugging him and the serfs men and maids flocked into the room
exclaiming and ohing and ahing

Ptya clinging to his legs kept shouting And me too

Natsha after she had pulled him down toward her and covered his face
with kisses holding him tight by the skirt of his coat sprang away and
pranced up and down in one place like a goat and shrieked piercingly

All around were loving eyes glistening with tears of joy and all around
were lips seeking a kiss

Snya too all rosy red clung to his arm and radiant with bliss
looked eagerly toward his eyes waiting for the look for which she
longed Snya now was sixteen and she was very pretty especially at
this moment of happy rapturous excitement She gazed at him not taking
her eyes off him and smiling and holding her breath He gave her a
grateful look but was still expectant and looking for someone The old
countess had not yet come But now steps were heard at the door steps
so rapid that they could hardly be his mothers

Yet it was she dressed in a new gown which he did not know made since
he had left All the others let him go and he ran to her When they
met she fell on his breast sobbing She could not lift her face but
only pressed it to the cold braiding of his hussars jacket Denisov
who had come into the room unnoticed by anyone stood there and wiped
his eyes at the sight

Vasli Denisov your sons friend he said introducing himself to the
count who was looking inquiringly at him

You are most welcome I know I know said the count kissing and
embracing Denisov Nicholas wrote us Natsha Vra look Here is
Denisov

The same happy rapturous faces turned to the shaggy figure of Denisov

Darling Denisov screamed Natsha beside herself with rapture
springing to him putting her arms round him and kissing him This
escapade made everybody feel confused Denisov blushed too but smiled
and taking Natshas hand kissed it

Denisov was shown to the room prepared for him and the Rostvs all
gathered round Nicholas in the sitting room

The old countess not letting go of his hand and kissing it every
moment sat beside him the rest crowding round him watched every
movement word or look of his never taking their blissfully adoring
eyes off him His brother and sisters struggled for the places nearest
to him and disputed with one another who should bring him his tea
handkerchief and pipe

Rostv was very happy in the love they showed him but the first moment
of meeting had been so beatific that his present joy seemed
insufficient and he kept expecting something more more and yet more

Next morning after the fatigues of their journey the travelers slept
till ten oclock

In the room next their bedroom there was a confusion of sabers
satchels sabretaches open portmanteaus and dirty boots Two freshly
cleaned pairs with spurs had just been placed by the wall The servants
were bringing in jugs and basins hot water for shaving and their well
brushed clothes There was a masculine odor and a smell of tobacco

Hallo Gwiskamy pipe came Vasli Denisovs husky voice Wostov get
up

Rostv rubbing his eyes that seemed glued together raised his
disheveled head from the hot pillow

Why is it late

Late Its nearly ten oclock answered Natshas voice A rustle of
starched petticoats and the whispering and laughter of girls voices
came from the adjoining room The door was opened a crack and there was
a glimpse of something blue of ribbons black hair and merry faces It
was Natsha Snya and Ptya who had come to see whether they were
getting up

Nicholas Get up Natshas voice was again heard at the door

Directly

Meanwhile Ptya having found and seized the sabers in the outer room
with the delight boys feel at the sight of a military elder brother and
forgetting that it was unbecoming for the girls to see men undressed
opened the bedroom door

Is this your saber he shouted

The girls sprang aside Denisov hid his hairy legs under the blanket
looking with a scared face at his comrade for help The door having let
Ptya in closed again A sound of laughter came from behind it

Nicholas Come out in your dressing gown said Natshas voice

Is this your saber asked Ptya Or is it yours he said addressing
the blackmustached Denisov with servile deference

Rostv hurriedly put something on his feet drew on his dressing gown
and went out Natsha had put on one spurred boot and was just getting
her foot into the other Snya when he came in was twirling round and
was about to expand her dresses into a balloon and sit down They were
dressed alike in new paleblue frocks and were both fresh rosy and
bright Snya ran away but Natsha taking her brothers arm led him
into the sitting room where they began talking They hardly gave one
another time to ask questions and give replies concerning a thousand
little matters which could not interest anyone but themselves Natsha
laughed at every word he said or that she said herself not because what
they were saying was amusing but because she felt happy and was unable
to control her joy which expressed itself by laughter

Oh how nice how splendid she said to everything

Rostv felt that under the influence of the warm rays of love that
childlike smile which had not once appeared on his face since he left
home now for the first time after eighteen months again brightened his
soul and his face

No but listen she said now you are quite a man arent you Im
awfully glad youre my brother She touched his mustache I want to
know what you men are like Are you the same as we No

Why did Snya run away asked Rostv

Ah yes Thats a whole long story How are you going to speak to
herthou or you

As may happen said Rostv

No call her you please Ill tell you all about it some other time
No Ill tell you now You know Snyas my dearest friend Such a friend
that I burned my arm for her sake Look here

She pulled up her muslin sleeve and showed him a red scar on her long
slender delicate arm high above the elbow on that part that is covered
even by a ball dress

I burned this to prove my love for her I just heated a ruler in the
fire and pressed it there

Sitting on the sofa with the little cushions on its arms in what used
to be his old schoolroom and looking into Natshas wildly bright eyes
Rostv reentered that world of home and childhood which had no meaning
for anyone else but gave him some of the best joys of his life and the
burning of an arm with a ruler as a proof of love did not seem to him
senseless he understood and was not surprised at it

Well and is that all he asked

We are such friends such friends All that ruler business was just
nonsense but we are friends forever She if she loves anyone does it
for life but I dont understand that I forget quickly

Well what then

Well she loves me and you like that

Natsha suddenly flushed

Why you remember before you went away Well she says you are to
forget all that She says I shall love him always but let him be
free Isnt that lovely and noble Yes very noble Isnt it asked
Natsha so seriously and excitedly that it was evident that what she
was now saying she had talked of before with tears

Rostv became thoughtful

I never go back on my word he said Besides Snya is so charming
that only a fool would renounce such happiness

No no cried Natsha she and I have already talked it over We knew
youd say so But it wont do because you see if you say thatif you
consider yourself bound by your promiseit will seem as if she had not
meant it seriously It makes it as if you were marrying her because you
must and that wouldnt do at all

Rostv saw that it had been well considered by them Snya had already
struck him by her beauty on the preceding day Today when he had caught
a glimpse of her she seemed still more lovely She was a charming girl
of sixteen evidently passionately in love with him he did not doubt
that for an instant Why should he not love her now and even marry
her Rostv thought but just now there were so many other pleasures and
interests before him Yes they have taken a wise decision he
thought I must remain free

Well then thats excellent said he Well talk it over later on
Oh how glad I am to have you

Well and are you still true to Bors he continued

Oh what nonsense cried Natsha laughing I dont think about him
or anyone else and I dont want anything of the kind

Dear me Then what are you up to now

Now repeated Natsha and a happy smile lit up her face Have you
seen Duport

No

Not seen Duportthe famous dancer Well then you wont understand
Thats what Im up to

Curving her arms Natsha held out her skirts as dancers do ran back a
few steps turned cut a caper brought her little feet sharply
together and made some steps on the very tips of her toes

See Im standing See she said but could not maintain herself on
her toes any longer So thats what Im up to Ill never marry anyone
but will be a dancer Only dont tell anyone

Rostv laughed so loud and merrily that Denisov in his bedroom felt
envious and Natsha could not help joining in

No but dont you think its nice she kept repeating

Nice And so you no longer wish to marry Bors

Natsha flared up I dont want to marry anyone And Ill tell him so
when I see him

Dear me said Rostv

But thats all rubbish Natsha chattered on And is Denisov nice
she asked

Yes indeed

Oh well then goodby go and dress Is he very terrible Denisov

Why terrible asked Nicholas No Vaska is a splendid fellow

You call him Vaska Thats funny And is he very nice

Very

Well then be quick Well all have breakfast together

And Natsha rose and went out of the room on tiptoe like a ballet
dancer but smiling as only happy girls of fifteen can smile When
Rostv met Snya in the drawing room he reddened He did not know how
to behave with her The evening before in the first happy moment of
meeting they had kissed each other but today they felt it could not be
done he felt that everybody including his mother and sisters was
looking inquiringly at him and watching to see how he would behave with
her He kissed her hand and addressed her not as thou but as youSnya
But their eyes met and said thou and exchanged tender kisses Her looks
asked him to forgive her for having dared by Natshas intermediacy to
remind him of his promise and then thanked him for his love His looks
thanked her for offering him his freedom and told her that one way or
another he would never cease to love her for that would be impossible

How strange it is said Vra selecting a moment when all were silent
that Snya and Nicholas now say you to one another and meet like
strangers

Vras remark was correct as her remarks always were but like most of
her observations it made everyone feel uncomfortable not only Snya
Nicholas and Natsha but even the old countess whodreading this love
affair which might hinder Nicholas from making a brilliant matchblushed
like a girl

Denisov to Rostvs surprise appeared in the drawing room with pomaded
hair perfumed and in a new uniform looking just as smart as he made
himself when going into battle and he was more amiable to the ladies
and gentlemen than Rostv had ever expected to see him





CHAPTER II

On his return to Moscow from the army Nicholas Rostv was welcomed by
his home circle as the best of sons a hero and their darling
Nikolenka by his relations as a charming attractive and polite young
man by his acquaintances as a handsome lieutenant of hussars a good
dancer and one of the best matches in the city

The Rostvs knew everybody in Moscow The old count had money enough
that year as all his estates had been remortgaged and so Nicholas
acquiring a trotter of his own very stylish riding breeches of the
latest cut such as no one else yet had in Moscow and boots of the
latest fashion with extremely pointed toes and small silver spurs
passed his time very gaily After a short period of adapting himself to
the old conditions of life Nicholas found it very pleasant to be at
home again He felt that he had grown up and matured very much His
despair at failing in a Scripture examination his borrowing money from
Gavril to pay a sleigh driver his kissing Snya on the slyhe now
recalled all this as childishness he had left immeasurably behind Now
he was a lieutenant of hussars in a jacket laced with silver and
wearing the Cross of St George awarded to soldiers for bravery in
action and in the company of wellknown elderly and respected racing
men was training a trotter of his own for a race He knew a lady on one
of the boulevards whom he visited of an evening He led the mazurka at
the Arkhrovs ball talked about the war with Field Marshal Kamenski
visited the English Club and was on intimate terms with a colonel of
forty to whom Denisov had introduced him

His passion for the Emperor had cooled somewhat in Moscow But still as
he did not see him and had no opportunity of seeing him he often spoke
about him and about his love for him letting it be understood that he
had not told all and that there was something in his feelings for the
Emperor not everyone could understand and with his whole soul he shared
the adoration then common in Moscow for the Emperor who was spoken of
as the angel incarnate

During Rostvs short stay in Moscow before rejoining the army he did
not draw closer to Snya but rather drifted away from her She was very
pretty and sweet and evidently deeply in love with him but he was at
the period of youth when there seems so much to do that there is no time
for that sort of thing and a young man fears to bind himself and prizes
his freedom which he needs for so many other things When he thought of
Snya during this stay in Moscow he said to himself Ah there will
be and there are many more such girls somewhere whom I do not yet
know There will be time enough to think about love when I want to but
now I have no time Besides it seemed to him that the society of women
was rather derogatory to his manhood He went to balls and into ladies
society with an affectation of doing so against his will The races the
English Club sprees with Denisov and visits to a certain housethat
was another matter and quite the thing for a dashing young hussar

At the beginning of March old Count Ily Rostv was very busy arranging
a dinner in honor of Prince Bagration at the English Club

The count walked up and down the hall in his dressing gown giving
orders to the club steward and to the famous Feoktist the clubs head
cook about asparagus fresh cucumbers strawberries veal and fish for
this dinner The count had been a member and on the committee of the
club from the day it was founded To him the club entrusted the
arrangement of the festival in honor of Bagration for few men knew so
well how to arrange a feast on an openhanded hospitable scale and
still fewer men would be so well able and willing to make up out of
their own resources what might be needed for the success of the fete
The club cook and the steward listened to the counts orders with
pleased faces for they knew that under no other management could they
so easily extract a good profit for themselves from a dinner costing
several thousand rubles

Well then mind and have cocks comb in the turtle soup you know

Shall we have three cold dishes then asked the cook

The count considered

We cant have lessyes three the mayonnaise thats one said he
bending down a finger

Then am I to order those large sterlets asked the steward

Yes it cant be helped if they wont take less Ah dear me I was
forgetting We must have another entree Ah goodness gracious he
clutched at his head Who is going to get me the flowers Dmtri Eh
Dmtri Gallop off to our Moscow estate he said to the factotum who
appeared at his call Hurry off and tell Maksim the gardener to set
the serfs to work Say that everything out of the hothouses must be
brought here well wrapped up in felt I must have two hundred pots here
on Friday

Having given several more orders he was about to go to his little
countess to have a rest but remembering something else of importance
he returned again called back the cook and the club steward and again
began giving orders A light footstep and the clinking of spurs were
heard at the door and the young count handsome rosy with a dark
little mustache evidently rested and made sleeker by his easy life in
Moscow entered the room

Ah my boy my heads in a whirl said the old man with a smile as if
he felt a little confused before his son Now if you would only help a
bit I must have singers too I shall have my own orchestra but
shouldnt we get the gypsy singers as well You military men like that
sort of thing

Really Papa I believe Prince Bagration worried himself less before
the battle of Schon Grabern than you do now said his son with a smile

The old count pretended to be angry

Yes you talk but try it yourself

And the count turned to the cook who with a shrewd and respectful
expression looked observantly and sympathetically at the father and
son

What have the young people come to nowadays eh Feoktist said he
Laughing at us old fellows

Thats so your excellency all they have to do is to eat a good
dinner but providing it and serving it all up thats not their
business

Thats it thats it exclaimed the count and gaily seizing his son
by both hands he cried Now Ive got you so take the sleigh and pair
at once and go to Bezkhovs and tell him Count Ily has sent you to
ask for strawberries and fresh pineapples We cant get them from
anyone else Hes not there himself so youll have to go in and ask the
princesses and from there go on to the Rasgulyaythe coachman Ipatka
knowsand look up the gypsy Ilyushka the one who danced at Count
Orlvs you remember in a white Cossack coat and bring him along to
me

And am I to bring the gypsy girls along with him asked Nicholas
laughing Dear dear

At that moment with noiseless footsteps and with the businesslike
preoccupied yet meekly Christian look which never left her face Anna
Mikhylovna entered the hall Though she came upon the count in his
dressing gown every day he invariably became confused and begged her to
excuse his costume

No matter at all my dear count she said meekly closing her eyes
But Ill go to Bezkhovs myself Pierre has arrived and now we shall
get anything we want from his hothouses I have to see him in any case
He has forwarded me a letter from Bors Thank God Bors is now on the
staff

The count was delighted at Anna Mikhylovnas taking upon herself one of
his commissions and ordered the small closed carriage for her

Tell Bezkhov to come Ill put his name down Is his wife with him
he asked

Anna Mikhylovna turned up her eyes and profound sadness was depicted
on her face

Ah my dear friend he is very unfortunate she said If what we hear
is true it is dreadful How little we dreamed of such a thing when we
were rejoicing at his happiness And such a lofty angelic soul as young
Bezkhov Yes I pity him from my heart and shall try to give him what
consolation I can

Whwhat is the matter asked both the young and old Rostv

Anna Mikhylovna sighed deeply

Dlokhov Mary Ivnovnas son she said in a mysterious whisper has
compromised her completely they say Pierre took him up invited him to
his house in Petersburg and now she has come here and that daredevil
after her said Anna Mikhylovna wishing to show her sympathy for
Pierre but by involuntary intonations and a half smile betraying her
sympathy for the daredevil as she called Dlokhov They say Pierre
is quite broken by his misfortune

Dear dear But still tell him to come to the clubit will all blow
over It will be a tremendous banquet

Next day the third of March soon after one oclock two hundred and
fifty members of the English Club and fifty guests were awaiting the
guest of honor and hero of the Austrian campaign Prince Bagration to
dinner

On the first arrival of the news of the battle of Austerlitz Moscow had
been bewildered At that time the Russians were so used to victories
that on receiving news of the defeat some would simply not believe it
while others sought some extraordinary explanation of so strange an
event In the English Club where all who were distinguished important
and well informed foregathered when the news began to arrive in
December nothing was said about the war and the last battle as though
all were in a conspiracy of silence The men who set the tone in
conversationCount Rostopchin Prince Yuri Dolgorukov Valuev Count
Markov and Prince Vyazemskidid not show themselves at the club but
met in private houses in intimate circles and the Moscovites who took
their opinions from othersIly Rostv among themremained for a while
without any definite opinion on the subject of the war and without
leaders The Moscovites felt that something was wrong and that to
discuss the bad news was difficult and so it was best to be silent But
after a while just as a jury comes out of its room the bigwigs who
guided the clubs opinion reappeared and everybody began speaking
clearly and definitely Reasons were found for the incredible unheard
of and impossible event of a Russian defeat everything became clear
and in all corners of Moscow the same things began to be said These
reasons were the treachery of the Austrians a defective commissariat
the treachery of the Pole Przebyszewski and of the Frenchman Langeron
Kutzovs incapacity and it was whispered the youth and inexperience
of the sovereign who had trusted worthless and insignificant people
But the army the Russian army everyone declared was extraordinary and
had achieved miracles of valor The soldiers officers and generals
were heroes But the hero of heroes was Prince Bagration distinguished
by his Schon Grabern affair and by the retreat from Austerlitz where he
alone had withdrawn his column unbroken and had all day beaten back an
enemy force twice as numerous as his own What also conduced to
Bagrations being selected as Moscows hero was the fact that he had no
connections in the city and was a stranger there In his person honor
was shown to a simple fighting Russian soldier without connections and
intrigues and to one who was associated by memories of the Italian
campaign with the name of Suvrov Moreover paying such honor to
Bagration was the best way of expressing disapproval and dislike of
Kutzov

Had there been no Bagration it would have been necessary to invent
him said the wit Shinshn parodying the words of Voltaire Kutzov no
one spoke of except some who abused him in whispers calling him a
court weathercock and an old satyr

All Moscow repeated Prince Dolgorukovs saying If you go on modeling
and modeling you must get smeared with clay suggesting consolation for
our defeat by the memory of former victories and the words of
Rostopchin that French soldiers have to be incited to battle by
highfalutin words and Germans by logical arguments to show them that it
is more dangerous to run away than to advance but that Russian soldiers
only need to be restrained and held back On all sides new and fresh
anecdotes were heard of individual examples of heroism shown by our
officers and men at Austerlitz One had saved a standard another had
killed five Frenchmen a third had loaded five cannon singlehanded Berg
was mentioned by those who did not know him as having when wounded in
the right hand taken his sword in the left and gone forward Of
Bolknski nothing was said and only those who knew him intimately
regretted that he had died so young leaving a pregnant wife with his
eccentric father





CHAPTER III

On that third of March all the rooms in the English Club were filled
with a hum of conversation like the hum of bees swarming in springtime
The members and guests of the club wandered hither and thither sat
stood met and separated some in uniform and some in evening dress
and a few here and there with powdered hair and in Russian kaftans
Powdered footmen in livery with buckled shoes and smart stockings
stood at every door anxiously noting visitors every movement in order
to offer their services Most of those present were elderly respected
men with broad selfconfident faces fat fingers and resolute gestures
and voices This class of guests and members sat in certain habitual
places and met in certain habitual groups A minority of those present
were casual guestschiefly young men among whom were Denisov Rostv
and Dlokhovwho was now again an officer in the Semnov regiment The
faces of these young people especially those who were military men
bore that expression of condescending respect for their elders which
seems to say to the older generation We are prepared to respect and
honor you but all the same remember that the future belongs to us

Nesvtski was there as an old member of the club Pierre who at his
wifes command had let his hair grow and abandoned his spectacles went
about the rooms fashionably dressed but looking sad and dull Here as
elsewhere he was surrounded by an atmosphere of subservience to his
wealth and being in the habit of lording it over these people he
treated them with absentminded contempt

By his age he should have belonged to the younger men but by his wealth
and connections he belonged to the groups of old and honored guests and
so he went from one group to another Some of the most important old men
were the center of groups which even strangers approached respectfully
to hear the voices of wellknown men The largest circles formed round
Count Rostopchin Valuev and Naryshkin Rostopchin was describing how
the Russians had been overwhelmed by flying Austrians and had had to
force their way through them with bayonets

Valuev was confidentially telling that Uvarov had been sent from
Petersburg to ascertain what Moscow was thinking about Austerlitz

In the third circle Naryshkin was speaking of the meeting of the
Austrian Council of War at which Suvrov crowed like a cock in reply to
the nonsense talked by the Austrian generals Shinshn standing close
by tried to make a joke saying that Kutzov had evidently failed to
learn from Suvrov even so simple a thing as the art of crowing like a
cock but the elder members glanced severely at the wit making him feel
that in that place and on that day it was improper to speak so of
Kutzov

Count Ily Rostv hurried and preoccupied went about in his soft boots
between the dining and drawing rooms hastily greeting the important and
unimportant all of whom he knew as if they were all equals while his
eyes occasionally sought out his fine wellsetup young son resting on
him and winking joyfully at him Young Rostv stood at a window with
Dlokhov whose acquaintance he had lately made and highly valued The
old count came up to them and pressed Dlokhovs hand

Please come and visit us you know my brave boy been together out
there both playing the hero Ah Vasli Ignatovich How dye do
old fellow he said turning to an old man who was passing but before
he had finished his greeting there was a general stir and a footman who
had run in announced with a frightened face Hes arrived

Bells rang the stewards rushed forward andlike rye shaken together in
a shovelthe guests who had been scattered about in different rooms came
together and crowded in the large drawing room by the door of the
ballroom

Bagration appeared in the doorway of the anteroom without hat or sword
which in accord with the club custom he had given up to the hall
porter He had no lambskin cap on his head nor had he a loaded whip
over his shoulder as when Rostv had seen him on the eve of the battle
of Austerlitz but wore a tight new uniform with Russian and foreign
Orders and the Star of St George on his left breast Evidently just
before coming to the dinner he had had his hair and whiskers trimmed
which changed his appearance for the worse There was something navely
festive in his air which in conjunction with his firm and virile
features gave him a rather comical expression Bekleshev and Theodore
Uvarov who had arrived with him paused at the doorway to allow him as
the guest of honor to enter first Bagration was embarrassed not
wishing to avail himself of their courtesy and this caused some delay
at the doors but after all he did at last enter first He walked shyly
and awkwardly over the parquet floor of the reception room not knowing
what to do with his hands he was more accustomed to walk over a plowed
field under fire as he had done at the head of the Kursk regiment at
Schon Grabernand he would have found that easier The committeemen met
him at the first door and expressing their delight at seeing such a
highly honored guest took possession of him as it were without waiting
for his reply surrounded him and led him to the drawing room It was
at first impossible to enter the drawing room door for the crowd of
members and guests jostling one another and trying to get a good look at
Bagration over each others shoulders as if he were some rare animal
Count Ily Rostv laughing and repeating the words Make way dear
boy Make way make way pushed through the crowd more energetically
than anyone led the guests into the drawing room and seated them on
the center sofa The bigwigs the most respected members of the club
beset the new arrivals Count Ily again thrusting his way through the
crowd went out of the drawing room and reappeared a minute later with
another committeeman carrying a large silver salver which he presented
to Prince Bagration On the salver lay some verses composed and printed
in the heros honor Bagration on seeing the salver glanced around in
dismay as though seeking help But all eyes demanded that he should
submit Feeling himself in their power he resolutely took the salver
with both hands and looked sternly and reproachfully at the count who
had presented it to him Someone obligingly took the dish from Bagration
or he would it seemed have held it till evening and have gone in to
dinner with it and drew his attention to the verses

Well I will read them then Bagration seemed to say and fixing his
weary eyes on the paper began to read them with a fixed and serious
expression But the author himself took the verses and began reading
them aloud Bagration bowed his head and listened

Bring glory then to Alexanders reign And on the throne our Titus
shield A dreaded foe be thou kindhearted as a man A Rhipheus at home
a Caesar in the field Een fortunate Napoleon Knows by experience now
Bagration And dare not Herculean Russians trouble

But before he had finished reading a stentorian majordomo announced
that dinner was ready The door opened and from the dining room came
the resounding strains of the polonaise

Conquests joyful thunder waken Triumph valiant Russians now

and Count Rostv glancing angrily at the author who went on reading his
verses bowed to Bagration Everyone rose feeling that dinner was more
important than verses and Bagration again preceding all the rest went
in to dinner He was seated in the place of honor between two
AlexandersBekleshev and Naryshkinwhich was a significant allusion to
the name of the sovereign Three hundred persons took their seats in the
dining room according to their rank and importance the more important
nearer to the honored guest as naturally as water flows deepest where
the land lies lowest

Just before dinner Count Ily Rostv presented his son to Bagration
who recognized him and said a few words to him disjointed and awkward
as were all the words he spoke that day and Count Ily looked joyfully
and proudly around while Bagration spoke to his son

Nicholas Rostv with Denisov and his new acquaintance Dlokhov sat
almost at the middle of the table Facing them sat Pierre beside Prince
Nesvtski Count Ily Rostv with the other members of the committee sat
facing Bagration and as the very personification of Moscow hospitality
did the honors to the prince

His efforts had not been in vain The dinner both the Lenten and the
other fare was splendid yet he could not feel quite at ease till the
end of the meal He winked at the butler whispered directions to the
footmen and awaited each expected dish with some anxiety Everything
was excellent With the second course a gigantic sterlet at sight of
which Ily Rostv blushed with selfconscious pleasure the footmen
began popping corks and filling the champagne glasses After the fish
which made a certain sensation the count exchanged glances with the
other committeemen There will be many toasts its time to begin he
whispered and taking up his glass he rose All were silent waiting
for what he would say

To the health of our Sovereign the Emperor he cried and at the same
moment his kindly eyes grew moist with tears of joy and enthusiasm The
band immediately struck up Conquests joyful thunder waken All rose
and cried Hurrah Bagration also rose and shouted Hurrah in exactly
the same voice in which he had shouted it on the field at Schon Grabern
Young Rostvs ecstatic voice could be heard above the three hundred
others He nearly wept To the health of our Sovereign the Emperor
he roared Hurrah and emptying his glass at one gulp he dashed it to
the floor Many followed his example and the loud shouting continued
for a long time When the voices subsided the footmen cleared away the
broken glass and everybody sat down again smiling at the noise they had
made and exchanging remarks The old count rose once more glanced at a
note lying beside his plate and proposed a toast To the health of the
hero of our last campaign Prince Peter Ivnovich Bagration and again
his blue eyes grew moist Hurrah cried the three hundred voices
again but instead of the band a choir began singing a cantata composed
by Paul Ivnovich Kutzov

Russians Oer all barriers on Courage conquest guarantees Have we not
Bagration He brings foe men to their knees etc

As soon as the singing was over another and another toast was proposed
and Count Ily Rostv became more and more moved more glass was
smashed and the shouting grew louder They drank to Bekleshev
Naryshkin Uvarov Dolgorukov Aprksin Valuev to the committee to
all the club members and to all the club guests and finally to Count
Ily Rostv separately as the organizer of the banquet At that toast
the count took out his handkerchief and covering his face wept
outright





CHAPTER IV

Pierre sat opposite Dlokhov and Nicholas Rostv As usual he ate and
drank much and eagerly But those who knew him intimately noticed that
some great change had come over him that day He was silent all through
dinner and looked about blinking and scowling or with fixed eyes and
a look of complete absentmindedness kept rubbing the bridge of his
nose His face was depressed and gloomy He seemed to see and hear
nothing of what was going on around him and to be absorbed by some
depressing and unsolved problem

The unsolved problem that tormented him was caused by hints given by the
princess his cousin at Moscow concerning Dlokhovs intimacy with his
wife and by an anonymous letter he had received that morning which in
the mean jocular way common to anonymous letters said that he saw badly
through his spectacles but that his wifes connection with Dlokhov was
a secret to no one but himself Pierre absolutely disbelieved both the
princess hints and the letter but he feared now to look at Dlokhov
who was sitting opposite him Every time he chanced to meet Dlokhovs
handsome insolent eyes Pierre felt something terrible and monstrous
rising in his soul and turned quickly away Involuntarily recalling his
wifes past and her relations with Dlokhov Pierre saw clearly that
what was said in the letter might be true or might at least seem to be
true had it not referred to his wife He involuntarily remembered how
Dlokhov who had fully recovered his former position after the
campaign had returned to Petersburg and come to him Availing himself
of his friendly relations with Pierre as a boon companion Dlokhov had
come straight to his house and Pierre had put him up and lent him
money Pierre recalled how Hlne had smilingly expressed disapproval of
Dlokhovs living at their house and how cynically Dlokhov had praised
his wifes beauty to him and from that time till they came to Moscow had
not left them for a day

Yes he is very handsome thought Pierre and I know him It would be
particularly pleasant to him to dishonor my name and ridicule me just
because I have exerted myself on his behalf befriended him and helped
him I know and understand what a spice that would add to the pleasure
of deceiving me if it really were true Yes if it were true but I do
not believe it I have no right to and cant believe it He
remembered the expression Dlokhovs face assumed in his moments of
cruelty as when tying the policeman to the bear and dropping them into
the water or when he challenged a man to a duel without any reason or
shot a postboys horse with a pistol That expression was often on
Dlokhovs face when looking at him Yes he is a bully thought
Pierre to kill a man means nothing to him It must seem to him that
everyone is afraid of him and that must please him He must think that
I too am afraid of himand in fact I am afraid of him he thought
and again he felt something terrible and monstrous rising in his soul
Dlokhov Denisov and Rostv were now sitting opposite Pierre and
seemed very gay Rostv was talking merrily to his two friends one of
whom was a dashing hussar and the other a notorious duelist and rake
and every now and then he glanced ironically at Pierre whose
preoccupied absentminded and massive figure was a very noticeable one
at the dinner Rostv looked inimically at Pierre first because Pierre
appeared to his hussar eyes as a rich civilian the husband of a beauty
and in a wordan old woman and secondly because Pierre in his
preoccupation and absentmindedness had not recognized Rostv and had
not responded to his greeting When the Emperors health was drunk
Pierre lost in thought did not rise or lift his glass

What are you about shouted Rostv looking at him in an ecstasy of
exasperation Dont you hear its His Majesty the Emperors health

Pierre sighed rose submissively emptied his glass and waiting till
all were seated again turned with his kindly smile to Rostv

Why I didnt recognize you he said But Rostv was otherwise
engaged he was shouting Hurrah

Why dont you renew the acquaintance said Dlokhov to Rostv

Confound him hes a fool said Rostv

One should make up to the husbands of pretty women said Denisov

Pierre did not catch what they were saying but knew they were talking
about him He reddened and turned away

Well now to the health of handsome women said Dlokhov and with a
serious expression but with a smile lurking at the corners of his
mouth he turned with his glass to Pierre

Heres to the health of lovely women Peterkinand their lovers he
added

Pierre with downcast eyes drank out of his glass without looking at
Dlokhov or answering him The footman who was distributing leaflets
with Kutzovs cantata laid one before Pierre as one of the principal
guests He was just going to take it when Dlokhov leaning across
snatched it from his hand and began reading it Pierre looked at
Dlokhov and his eyes dropped the something terrible and monstrous that
had tormented him all dinnertime rose and took possession of him He
leaned his whole massive body across the table

How dare you take it he shouted

Hearing that cry and seeing to whom it was addressed Nesvtski and the
neighbor on his right quickly turned in alarm to Bezkhov

Dont Dont What are you about whispered their frightened voices

Dlokhov looked at Pierre with clear mirthful cruel eyes and that
smile of his which seemed to say Ah This is what I like

You shant have it he said distinctly

Pale with quivering lips Pierre snatched the copy

You you scoundrel I challenge you he ejaculated and pushing
back his chair he rose from the table

At the very instant he did this and uttered those words Pierre felt
that the question of his wifes guilt which had been tormenting him the
whole day was finally and indubitably answered in the affirmative He
hated her and was forever sundered from her Despite Denisovs request
that he would take no part in the matter Rostv agreed to be Dlokhovs
second and after dinner he discussed the arrangements for the duel with
Nesvtski Bezkhovs second Pierre went home but Rostv with Dlokhov
and Denisov stayed on at the club till late listening to the gypsies
and other singers

Well then till tomorrow at Sokolniki said Dlokhov as he took leave
of Rostv in the club porch

And do you feel quite calm Rostv asked

Dlokhov paused

Well you see Ill tell you the whole secret of dueling in two words
If you are going to fight a duel and you make a will and write
affectionate letters to your parents and if you think you may be
killed you are a fool and are lost for certain But go with the firm
intention of killing your man as quickly and surely as possible and
then all will be right as our bear huntsman at Kostroma used to tell
me Everyone fears a bear he says but when you see one your fears
all gone and your only thought is not to let him get away And thats
how it is with me A demain mon cher

 Till tomorrow my dear fellow

Next day at eight in the morning Pierre and Nesvtski drove to the
Sokolniki forest and found Dlokhov Denisov and Rostv already there
Pierre had the air of a man preoccupied with considerations which had no
connection with the matter in hand His haggard face was yellow He had
evidently not slept that night He looked about distractedly and screwed
up his eyes as if dazzled by the sun He was entirely absorbed by two
considerations his wifes guilt of which after his sleepless night he
had not the slightest doubt and the guiltlessness of Dlokhov who had
no reason to preserve the honor of a man who was nothing to him I
should perhaps have done the same thing in his place thought Pierre
Its even certain that I should have done the same then why this duel
this murder Either I shall kill him or he will hit me in the head or
elbow or knee Cant I go away from here run away bury myself
somewhere passed through his mind But just at moments when such
thoughts occurred to him he would ask in a particularly calm and
absentminded way which inspired the respect of the onlookers Will it
be long Are things ready

When all was ready the sabers stuck in the snow to mark the barriers
and the pistols loaded Nesvtski went up to Pierre

I should not be doing my duty Count he said in timid tones and
should not justify your confidence and the honor you have done me in
choosing me for your second if at this grave this very grave moment I
did not tell you the whole truth I think there is no sufficient ground
for this affair or for blood to be shed over it You were not right
not quite in the right you were impetuous

Oh yes it is horribly stupid said Pierre

Then allow me to express your regrets and I am sure your opponent will
accept them said Nesvtski who like the others concerned in the
affair and like everyone in similar cases did not yet believe that the
affair had come to an actual duel You know Count it is much more
honorable to admit ones mistake than to let matters become irreparable
There was no insult on either side Allow me to convey

No What is there to talk about said Pierre Its all the same
Is everything ready he added Only tell me where to go and where to
shoot he said with an unnaturally gentle smile

He took the pistol in his hand and began asking about the working of the
trigger as he had not before held a pistol in his handa fact that he
did not wish to confess

Oh yes like that I know I only forgot said he

No apologies none whatever said Dlokhov to Denisov who on his side
had been attempting a reconciliation and he also went up to the
appointed place

The spot chosen for the duel was some eighty paces from the road where
the sleighs had been left in a small clearing in the pine forest
covered with melting snow the frost having begun to break up during the
last few days The antagonists stood forty paces apart at the farther
edge of the clearing The seconds measuring the paces left tracks in
the deep wet snow between the place where they had been standing and
Nesvtskis and Dlokhovs sabers which were stuck into the ground ten
paces apart to mark the barrier It was thawing and misty at forty
paces distance nothing could be seen For three minutes all had been
ready but they still delayed and all were silent





CHAPTER V

Well begin said Dlokhov

All right said Pierre still smiling in the same way A feeling of
dread was in the air It was evident that the affair so lightly begun
could no longer be averted but was taking its course independently of
mens will

Denisov first went to the barrier and announced As the advesawies
have wefused a weconciliation please pwoceed Take your pistols and at
the word thwee begin to advance

One Two Thwee he shouted angrily and stepped aside

The combatants advanced along the trodden tracks nearer and nearer to
one another beginning to see one another through the mist They had the
right to fire when they liked as they approached the barrier Dlokhov
walked slowly without raising his pistol looking intently with his
bright sparkling blue eyes into his antagonists face His mouth wore
its usual semblance of a smile

So I can fire when I like said Pierre and at the word three he
went quickly forward missing the trodden path and stepping into the
deep snow He held the pistol in his right hand at arms length
apparently afraid of shooting himself with it His left hand he held
carefully back because he wished to support his right hand with it and
knew he must not do so Having advanced six paces and strayed off the
track into the snow Pierre looked down at his feet then quickly
glanced at Dlokhov and bending his finger as he had been shown fired
Not at all expecting so loud a report Pierre shuddered at the sound and
then smiling at his own sensations stood still The smoke rendered
denser by the mist prevented him from seeing anything for an instant
but there was no second report as he had expected He only heard
Dlokhovs hurried steps and his figure came in view through the smoke
He was pressing one hand to his left side while the other clutched his
drooping pistol His face was pale Rostv ran toward him and said
something

Nooo muttered Dlokhov through his teeth no its not over And
after stumbling a few staggering steps right up to the saber he sank on
the snow beside it His left hand was bloody he wiped it on his coat
and supported himself with it His frowning face was pallid and
quivered

Plea began Dlokhov but could not at first pronounce the word

Please he uttered with an effort

Pierre hardly restraining his sobs began running toward Dlokhov and
was about to cross the space between the barriers when Dlokhov cried

To your barrier and Pierre grasping what was meant stopped by his
saber Only ten paces divided them Dlokhov lowered his head to the
snow greedily bit at it again raised his head adjusted himself drew
in his legs and sat up seeking a firm center of gravity He sucked and
swallowed the cold snow his lips quivered but his eyes still smiling
glittered with effort and exasperation as he mustered his remaining
strength He raised his pistol and aimed

Sideways Cover yourself with your pistol ejaculated Nesvtski

Cover yourself even Denisov cried to his adversary

Pierre with a gentle smile of pity and remorse his arms and legs
helplessly spread out stood with his broad chest directly facing
Dlokhov looked sorrowfully at him Denisov Rostv and Nesvtski
closed their eyes At the same instant they heard a report and
Dlokhovs angry cry

Missed shouted Dlokhov and he lay helplessly face downwards on the
snow

Pierre clutched his temples and turning round went into the forest
trampling through the deep snow and muttering incoherent words

Folly folly Death lies he repeated puckering his face

Nesvtski stopped him and took him home

Rostv and Denisov drove away with the wounded Dlokhov

The latter lay silent in the sleigh with closed eyes and did not answer
a word to the questions addressed to him But on entering Moscow he
suddenly came to and lifting his head with an effort took Rostv who
was sitting beside him by the hand Rostv was struck by the totally
altered and unexpectedly rapturous and tender expression on Dlokhovs
face

Well How do you feel he asked

Bad But its not that my friend said Dlokhov with a gasping voice
Where are we In Moscow I know I dont matter but I have killed her
killed She wont get over it She wont survive

Who asked Rostv

My mother My mother my angel my adored angel mother and Dlokhov
pressed Rostvs hand and burst into tears

When he had become a little quieter he explained to Rostv that he was
living with his mother who if she saw him dying would not survive it
He implored Rostv to go on and prepare her

Rostv went on ahead to do what was asked and to his great surprise
learned that Dlokhov the brawler Dlokhov the bully lived in Moscow
with an old mother and a hunchback sister and was the most affectionate
of sons and brothers





CHAPTER VI

Pierre had of late rarely seen his wife alone Both in Petersburg and in
Moscow their house was always full of visitors The night after the duel
he did not go to his bedroom but as he often did remained in his
fathers room that huge room in which Count Bezkhov had died

He lay down on the sofa meaning to fall asleep and forget all that had
happened to him but could not do so Such a storm of feelings
thoughts and memories suddenly arose within him that he could not fall
asleep nor even remain in one place but had to jump up and pace the
room with rapid steps Now he seemed to see her in the early days of
their marriage with bare shoulders and a languid passionate look on
her face and then immediately he saw beside her Dlokhovs handsome
insolent hard and mocking face as he had seen it at the banquet and
then that same face pale quivering and suffering as it had been when
he reeled and sank on the snow

What has happened he asked himself I have killed her lover yes
killed my wifes lover Yes that was it And why How did I come to do
itBecause you married her answered an inner voice

But in what was I to blame he asked In marrying her without loving
her in deceiving yourself and her And he vividly recalled that moment
after supper at Prince Vaslis when he spoke those words he had found
so difficult to utter I love you It all comes from that Even then
I felt it he thought I felt then that it was not so that I had no
right to do it And so it turns out

He remembered his honeymoon and blushed at the recollection
Particularly vivid humiliating and shameful was the recollection of
how one day soon after his marriage he came out of the bedroom into his
study a little before noon in his silk dressing gown and found his head
steward there who bowing respectfully looked into his face and at his
dressing gown and smiled slightly as if expressing respectful
understanding of his employers happiness

But how often I have felt proud of her proud of her majestic beauty
and social tact thought he been proud of my house in which she
received all Petersburg proud of her unapproachability and beauty So
this is what I was proud of I then thought that I did not understand
her How often when considering her character I have told myself that I
was to blame for not understanding her for not understanding that
constant composure and complacency and lack of all interests or desires
and the whole secret lies in the terrible truth that she is a depraved
woman Now I have spoken that terrible word to myself all has become
clear

Anatole used to come to borrow money from her and used to kiss her
naked shoulders She did not give him the money but let herself be
kissed Her father in jest tried to rouse her jealousy and she replied
with a calm smile that she was not so stupid as to be jealous Let him
do what he pleases she used to say of me One day I asked her if she
felt any symptoms of pregnancy She laughed contemptuously and said she
was not a fool to want to have children and that she was not going to
have any children by me

Then he recalled the coarseness and bluntness of her thoughts and the
vulgarity of the expressions that were natural to her though she had
been brought up in the most aristocratic circles

Im not such a fool Just you try it on Allezvous promener
she used to say Often seeing the success she had with young and old men
and women Pierre could not understand why he did not love her

 You clear out of this

Yes I never loved her said he to himself I knew she was a depraved
woman he repeated but dared not admit it to myself And now theres
Dlokhov sitting in the snow with a forced smile and perhaps dying
while meeting my remorse with some forced bravado

Pierre was one of those people who in spite of an appearance of what is
called weak character do not seek a confidant in their troubles He
digested his sufferings alone

It is all all her fault he said to himself but what of that Why
did I bind myself to her Why did I say Je vous aime to her which
was a lie and worse than a lie I am guilty and must endure what A
slur on my name A misfortune for life Oh thats nonsense he
thought The slur on my name and honorthats all apart from myself

 I love you

Louis XVI was executed because they said he was dishonorable and a
criminal came into Pierres head and from their point of view they
were right as were those too who canonized him and died a martyrs
death for his sake Then Robespierre was beheaded for being a despot
Who is right and who is wrong No one But if you are alivelive
tomorrow youll die as I might have died an hour ago And is it worth
tormenting oneself when one has only a moment of life in comparison
with eternity

But at the moment when he imagined himself calmed by such reflections
she suddenly came into his mind as she was at the moments when he had
most strongly expressed his insincere love for her and he felt the
blood rush to his heart and had again to get up and move about and break
and tear whatever came to his hand Why did I tell her that Je vous
aime he kept repeating to himself And when he had said it for the
tenth time Molieres words Mais que diable allaitil faire dans cette
galere occurred to him and he began to laugh at himself

 But what the devil was he doing in that galley

In the night he called his valet and told him to pack up to go to
Petersburg He could not imagine how he could speak to her now He
resolved to go away next day and leave a letter informing her of his
intention to part from her forever

Next morning when the valet came into the room with his coffee Pierre
was lying asleep on the ottoman with an open book in his hand

He woke up and looked round for a while with a startled expression
unable to realize where he was

The countess told me to inquire whether your excellency was at home
said the valet

But before Pierre could decide what answer he would send the countess
herself in a white satin dressing gown embroidered with silver and with
simply dressed hair two immense plaits twice round her lovely head like
a coronet entered the room calm and majestic except that there was a
wrathful wrinkle on her rather prominent marble brow With her
imperturbable calm she did not begin to speak in front of the valet She
knew of the duel and had come to speak about it She waited till the
valet had set down the coffee things and left the room Pierre looked at
her timidly over his spectacles and like a hare surrounded by hounds
who lays back her ears and continues to crouch motionless before her
enemies he tried to continue reading But feeling this to be senseless
and impossible he again glanced timidly at her She did not sit down
but looked at him with a contemptuous smile waiting for the valet to
go

Well whats this now What have you been up to now I should like to
know she asked sternly

I What have I stammered Pierre

So it seems youre a hero eh Come now what was this duel about What
is it meant to prove What I ask you

Pierre turned over heavily on the ottoman and opened his mouth but
could not reply

If you wont answer Ill tell you Hlne went on You believe
everything youre told You were told Hlne laughed that Dlokhov
was my lover she said in French with her coarse plainness of speech
uttering the word amant as casually as any other word and you believed
it Well what have you proved What does this duel prove That youre a
fool que vous etes un sot but everybody knew that What will be the
result That I shall be the laughingstock of all Moscow that everyone
will say that you drunk and not knowing what you were about challenged
a man you are jealous of without cause Hlne raised her voice and
became more and more excited A man whos a better man than you in
every way

Hm Hm growled Pierre frowning without looking at her and not
moving a muscle

And how could you believe he was my lover Why Because I like his
company If you were cleverer and more agreeable I should prefer
yours

Dont speak to me I beg you muttered Pierre hoarsely

Why shouldnt I speak I can speak as I like and I tell you plainly
that there are not many wives with husbands such as you who would not
have taken lovers des amants but I have not done so said she

Pierre wished to say something looked at her with eyes whose strange
expression she did not understand and lay down again He was suffering
physically at that moment there was a weight on his chest and he could
not breathe He knew that he must do something to put an end to this
suffering but what he wanted to do was too terrible

We had better separate he muttered in a broken voice

Separate Very well but only if you give me a fortune said Hlne
Separate Thats a thing to frighten me with

Pierre leaped up from the sofa and rushed staggering toward her

Ill kill you he shouted and seizing the marble top of a table with
a strength he had never before felt he made a step toward her
brandishing the slab

Hlnes face became terrible she shrieked and sprang aside His
fathers nature showed itself in Pierre He felt the fascination and
delight of frenzy He flung down the slab broke it and swooping down
on her with outstretched hands shouted Get out in such a terrible
voice that the whole house heard it with horror God knows what he would
have done at that moment had Hlne not fled from the room

A week later Pierre gave his wife full power to control all his estates
in Great Russia which formed the larger part of his property and left
for Petersburg alone





CHAPTER VII

Two months had elapsed since the news of the battle of Austerlitz and
the loss of Prince Andrew had reached Bald Hills and in spite of the
letters sent through the embassy and all the searches made his body had
not been found nor was he on the list of prisoners What was worst of
all for his relations was the fact that there was still a possibility of
his having been picked up on the battlefield by the people of the place
and that he might now be lying recovering or dying alone among
strangers and unable to send news of himself The gazettes from which
the old prince first heard of the defeat at Austerlitz stated as usual
very briefly and vaguely that after brilliant engagements the Russians
had had to retreat and had made their withdrawal in perfect order The
old prince understood from this official report that our army had been
defeated A week after the gazette report of the battle of Austerlitz
came a letter from Kutzov informing the prince of the fate that had
befallen his son

Your son wrote Kutzov fell before my eyes a standard in his hand
and at the head of a regimenthe fell as a hero worthy of his father
and his fatherland To the great regret of myself and of the whole army
it is still uncertain whether he is alive or not I comfort myself and
you with the hope that your son is alive for otherwise he would have
been mentioned among the officers found on the field of battle a list
of whom has been sent me under flag of truce

After receiving this news late in the evening when he was alone in his
study the old prince went for his walk as usual next morning but he
was silent with his steward the gardener and the architect and though
he looked very grim he said nothing to anyone

When Princess Mary went to him at the usual hour he was working at his
lathe and as usual did not look round at her

Ah Princess Mary he said suddenly in an unnatural voice throwing
down his chisel The wheel continued to revolve by its own impetus and
Princess Mary long remembered the dying creak of that wheel which
merged in her memory with what followed

She approached him saw his face and something gave way within her Her
eyes grew dim By the expression of her fathers face not sad not
crushed but angry and working unnaturally she saw that hanging over
her and about to crush her was some terrible misfortune the worst in
life one she had not yet experienced irreparable and
incomprehensiblethe death of one she loved

Father Andrewsaid the ungraceful awkward princess with such an
indescribable charm of sorrow and selfforgetfulness that her father
could not bear her look but turned away with a sob

Bad news Hes not among the prisoners nor among the killed Kutzov
writes and he screamed as piercingly as if he wished to drive the
princess away by that scream Killed

The princess did not fall down or faint She was already pale but on
hearing these words her face changed and something brightened in her
beautiful radiant eyes It was as if joya supreme joy apart from the
joys and sorrows of this worldoverflowed the great grief within her
She forgot all fear of her father went up to him took his hand and
drawing him down put her arm round his thin scraggy neck

Father she said do not turn away from me let us weep together

Scoundrels Blackguards shrieked the old man turning his face away
from her Destroying the army destroying the men And why Go go and
tell Lise

The princess sank helplessly into an armchair beside her father and
wept She saw her brother now as he had been at the moment when he took
leave of her and of Lise his look tender yet proud She saw him tender
and amused as he was when he put on the little icon Did he believe
Had he repented of his unbelief Was he now there There in the realms
of eternal peace and blessedness she thought

Father tell me how it happened she asked through her tears

Go Go Killed in battle where the best of Russian men and Russias
glory were led to destruction Go Princess Mary Go and tell Lise I
will follow

When Princess Mary returned from her father the little princess sat
working and looked up with that curious expression of inner happy calm
peculiar to pregnant women It was evident that her eyes did not see
Princess Mary but were looking within into herself at something
joyful and mysterious taking place within her

Mary she said moving away from the embroidery frame and lying back
give me your hand She took her sisterinlaws hand and held it below
her waist

Her eyes were smiling expectantly her downy lip rose and remained
lifted in childlike happiness

Princess Mary knelt down before her and hid her face in the folds of her
sisterinlaws dress

There there Do you feel it I feel so strange And do you know Mary
I am going to love him very much said Lise looking with bright and
happy eyes at her sisterinlaw

Princess Mary could not lift her head she was weeping

What is the matter Mary

Nothing only I feel sad sad about Andrew she said wiping away
her tears on her sisterinlaws knee

Several times in the course of the morning Princess Mary began trying to
prepare her sisterinlaw and every time began to cry Unobservant as
was the little princess these tears the cause of which she did not
understand agitated her She said nothing but looked about uneasily as
if in search of something Before dinner the old prince of whom she was
always afraid came into her room with a peculiarly restless and malign
expression and went out again without saying a word She looked at
Princess Mary then sat thinking for a while with that expression of
attention to something within her that is only seen in pregnant women
and suddenly began to cry

Has anything come from Andrew she asked

No you know its too soon for news But my father is anxious and I
feel afraid

So theres nothing

Nothing answered Princess Mary looking firmly with her radiant eyes
at her sisterinlaw

She had determined not to tell her and persuaded her father to hide the
terrible news from her till after her confinement which was expected
within a few days Princess Mary and the old prince each bore and hid
their grief in their own way The old prince would not cherish any hope
he made up his mind that Prince Andrew had been killed and though he
sent an official to Austria to seek for traces of his son he ordered a
monument from Moscow which he intended to erect in his own garden to his
memory and he told everybody that his son had been killed He tried not
to change his former way of life but his strength failed him He walked
less ate less slept less and became weaker every day Princess Mary
hoped She prayed for her brother as living and was always awaiting news
of his return





CHAPTER VIII

Dearest said the little princess after breakfast on the morning of
the nineteenth March and her downy little lip rose from old habit but
as sorrow was manifest in every smile the sound of every word and even
every footstep in that house since the terrible news had come so now
the smile of the little princessinfluenced by the general mood though
without knowing its causewas such as to remind one still more of the
general sorrow

Dearest Im afraid this mornings fruschtique as Foka the cook calls
ithas disagreed with me

 Fruhstuck breakfast

What is the matter with you my darling You look pale Oh you are
very pale said Princess Mary in alarm running with her soft
ponderous steps up to her sisterinlaw

Your excellency should not Mary Bogdanovna be sent for said one of
the maids who was present Mary Bogdanovna was a midwife from the
neighboring town who had been at Bald Hills for the last fortnight

Oh yes assented Princess Mary perhaps thats it Ill go Courage
my angel She kissed Lise and was about to leave the room

Oh no no And besides the pallor and the physical suffering on the
little princess face an expression of childish fear of inevitable pain
showed itself

No its only indigestion Say its only indigestion say so Mary
Say And the little princess began to cry capriciously like a
suffering child and to wring her little hands even with some
affectation Princess Mary ran out of the room to fetch Mary Bogdanovna

Mon Dieu Mon Dieu Oh she heard as she left the room

The midwife was already on her way to meet her rubbing her small plump
white hands with an air of calm importance

Mary Bogdanovna I think its beginning said Princess Mary looking at
the midwife with wideopen eyes of alarm

Well the Lord be thanked Princess said Mary Bogdanovna not
hastening her steps You young ladies should not know anything about
it

But how is it the doctor from Moscow is not here yet said the
princess In accordance with Lises and Prince Andrews wishes they had
sent in good time to Moscow for a doctor and were expecting him at any
moment

No matter Princess dont be alarmed said Mary Bogdanovna Well
manage very well without a doctor

Five minutes later Princess Mary from her room heard something heavy
being carried by She looked out The men servants were carrying the
large leather sofa from Prince Andrews study into the bedroom On their
faces was a quiet and solemn look

Princess Mary sat alone in her room listening to the sounds in the
house now and then opening her door when someone passed and watching
what was going on in the passage Some women passing with quiet steps in
and out of the bedroom glanced at the princess and turned away She did
not venture to ask any questions and shut the door again now sitting
down in her easy chair now taking her prayer book now kneeling before
the icon stand To her surprise and distress she found that her prayers
did not calm her excitement Suddenly her door opened softly and her old
nurse Praskovya Savishna who hardly ever came to that room as the old
prince had forbidden it appeared on the threshold with a shawl round
her head

Ive come to sit with you a bit Msha said the nurse and here Ive
brought the princes wedding candles to light before his saint my
angel she said with a sigh

Oh nurse Im so glad

God is merciful birdie

The nurse lit the gilt candles before the icons and sat down by the door
with her knitting Princess Mary took a book and began reading Only
when footsteps or voices were heard did they look at one another the
princess anxious and inquiring the nurse encouraging Everyone in the
house was dominated by the same feeling that Princess Mary experienced
as she sat in her room But owing to the superstition that the fewer the
people who know of it the less a woman in travail suffers everyone
tried to pretend not to know no one spoke of it but apart from the
ordinary staid and respectful good manners habitual in the princes
household a common anxiety a softening of the heart and a
consciousness that something great and mysterious was being accomplished
at that moment made itself felt

There was no laughter in the maids large hall In the men servants
hall all sat waiting silently and alert In the outlying serfs
quarters torches and candles were burning and no one slept The old
prince stepping on his heels paced up and down his study and sent
Tkhon to ask Mary Bogdanovna what newsSay only that the prince told
me to ask and come and tell me her answer

Inform the prince that labor has begun said Mary Bogdanovna giving
the messenger a significant look

Tkhon went and told the prince

Very good said the prince closing the door behind him and Tkhon did
not hear the slightest sound from the study after that

After a while he reentered it as if to snuff the candles and seeing
the prince was lying on the sofa looked at him noticed his perturbed
face shook his head and going up to him silently kissed him on the
shoulder and left the room without snuffing the candles or saying why he
had entered The most solemn mystery in the world continued its course
Evening passed night came and the feeling of suspense and softening of
heart in the presence of the unfathomable did not lessen but increased
No one slept

It was one of those March nights when winter seems to wish to resume its
sway and scatters its last snows and storms with desperate fury A relay
of horses had been sent up the highroad to meet the German doctor from
Moscow who was expected every moment and men on horseback with lanterns
were sent to the crossroads to guide him over the country road with its
hollows and snowcovered pools of water

Princess Mary had long since put aside her book she sat silent her
luminous eyes fixed on her nurses wrinkled face every line of which
she knew so well on the lock of gray hair that escaped from under the
kerchief and the loose skin that hung under her chin

Nurse Savishna knitting in hand was telling in low tones scarcely
hearing or understanding her own words what she had told hundreds of
times before how the late princess had given birth to Princess Mary in
Kishenev with only a Moldavian peasant woman to help instead of a
midwife

God is merciful doctors are never needed she said

Suddenly a gust of wind beat violently against the casement of the
window from which the double frame had been removed by order of the
prince one window frame was removed in each room as soon as the larks
returned and forcing open a loosely closed latch set the damask
curtain flapping and blew out the candle with its chill snowy draft
Princess Mary shuddered her nurse putting down the stocking she was
knitting went to the window and leaning out tried to catch the open
casement The cold wind flapped the ends of her kerchief and her loose
locks of gray hair

Princess my dear theres someone driving up the avenue she said
holding the casement and not closing it With lanterns Most likely the
doctor

Oh my God thank God said Princess Mary I must go and meet him he
does not know Russian

Princess Mary threw a shawl over her head and ran to meet the newcomer
As she was crossing the anteroom she saw through the window a carriage
with lanterns standing at the entrance She went out on the stairs On
a banister post stood a tallow candle which guttered in the draft On
the landing below Philip the footman stood looking scared and holding
another candle Still lower beyond the turn of the staircase one could
hear the footstep of someone in thick felt boots and a voice that
seemed familiar to Princess Mary was saying something

Thank God said the voice And Father

Gone to bed replied the voice of Demyan the house steward who was
downstairs

Then the voice said something more Demyan replied and the steps in the
felt boots approached the unseen bend of the staircase more rapidly

Its Andrew thought Princess Mary No it cant be that would be too
extraordinary and at the very moment she thought this the face and
figure of Prince Andrew in a fur cloak the deep collar of which covered
with snow appeared on the landing where the footman stood with the
candle Yes it was he pale thin with a changed and strangely
softened but agitated expression on his face He came up the stairs and
embraced his sister

You did not get my letter he asked and not waiting for a replywhich
he would not have received for the princess was unable to speakhe
turned back rapidly mounted the stairs again with the doctor who had
entered the hall after him they had met at the last post station and
again embraced his sister

What a strange fate Msha darling And having taken off his cloak and
felt boots he went to the little princess apartment





CHAPTER IX

The little princess lay supported by pillows with a white cap on her
head the pains had just left her Strands of her black hair lay round
her inflamed and perspiring cheeks her charming rosy mouth with its
downy lip was open and she was smiling joyfully Prince Andrew entered
and paused facing her at the foot of the sofa on which she was lying
Her glittering eyes filled with childlike fear and excitement rested
on him without changing their expression I love you all and have done
no harm to anyone why must I suffer so Help me her look seemed to
say She saw her husband but did not realize the significance of his
appearance before her now Prince Andrew went round the sofa and kissed
her forehead

My darling he saida word he had never used to her before God is
merciful

She looked at him inquiringly and with childlike reproach

I expected help from you and I get none none from you either said
her eyes She was not surprised at his having come she did not realize
that he had come His coming had nothing to do with her sufferings or
with their relief The pangs began again and Mary Bogdanovna advised
Prince Andrew to leave the room

The doctor entered Prince Andrew went out and meeting Princess Mary
again joined her They began talking in whispers but their talk broke
off at every moment They waited and listened

Go dear said Princess Mary

Prince Andrew went again to his wife and sat waiting in the room next to
hers A woman came from the bedroom with a frightened face and became
confused when she saw Prince Andrew He covered his face with his hands
and remained so for some minutes Piteous helpless animal moans came
through the door Prince Andrew got up went to the door and tried to
open it Someone was holding it shut

You cant come in You cant said a terrified voice from within

He began pacing the room The screaming ceased and a few more seconds
went by Then suddenly a terrible shriekit could not be hers she could
not scream like thatcame from the bedroom Prince Andrew ran to the
door the scream ceased and he heard the wail of an infant

What have they taken a baby in there for thought Prince Andrew in the
first second A baby What baby Why is there a baby there Or is
the baby born

Then suddenly he realized the joyful significance of that wail tears
choked him and leaning his elbows on the window sill be began to cry
sobbing like a child The door opened The doctor with his shirt sleeves
tucked up without a coat pale and with a trembling jaw came out of
the room Prince Andrew turned to him but the doctor gave him a
bewildered look and passed by without a word A woman rushed out and
seeing Prince Andrew stopped hesitating on the threshold He went into
his wifes room She was lying dead in the same position he had seen
her in five minutes before and despite the fixed eyes and the pallor of
the cheeks the same expression was on her charming childlike face with
its upper lip covered with tiny black hair

I love you all and have done no harm to anyone and what have you done
to mesaid her charming pathetic dead face

In a corner of the room something red and tiny gave a grunt and squealed
in Mary Bogdanovnas trembling white hands

Two hours later Prince Andrew stepping softly went into his fathers
room The old man already knew everything He was standing close to the
door and as soon as it opened his rough old arms closed like a vise
round his sons neck and without a word he began to sob like a child

Three days later the little princess was buried and Prince Andrew went
up the steps to where the coffin stood to give her the farewell kiss
And there in the coffin was the same face though with closed eyes Ah
what have you done to me it still seemed to say and Prince Andrew
felt that something gave way in his soul and that he was guilty of a sin
he could neither remedy nor forget He could not weep The old man too
came up and kissed the waxen little hands that lay quietly crossed one
on the other on her breast and to him too her face seemed to say
Ah what have you done to me and why And at the sight the old man
turned angrily away

Another five days passed and then the young Prince Nicholas Andrevich
was baptized The wet nurse supported the coverlet with her chin while
the priest with a goose feather anointed the boys little red and
wrinkled soles and palms

His grandfather who was his godfather trembling and afraid of dropping
him carried the infant round the battered tin font and handed him over
to the godmother Princess Mary Prince Andrew sat in another room
faint with fear lest the baby should be drowned in the font and awaited
the termination of the ceremony He looked up joyfully at the baby when
the nurse brought it to him and nodded approval when she told him that
the wax with the babys hair had not sunk in the font but had floated





CHAPTER X

Rostvs share in Dlokhovs duel with Bezkhov was hushed up by the
efforts of the old count and instead of being degraded to the ranks as
he expected he was appointed an adjutant to the governor general of
Moscow As a result he could not go to the country with the rest of the
family but was kept all summer in Moscow by his new duties Dlokhov
recovered and Rostv became very friendly with him during his
convalescence Dlokhov lay ill at his mothers who loved him
passionately and tenderly and old Mary Ivnovna who had grown fond of
Rostv for his friendship to her Fedya often talked to him about her
son

Yes Count she would say he is too noble and puresouled for our
present depraved world No one now loves virtue it seems like a
reproach to everyone Now tell me Count was it right was it
honorable of Bezkhov And Fedya with his noble spirit loved him and
even now never says a word against him Those pranks in Petersburg when
they played some tricks on a policeman didnt they do it together And
there Bezkhov got off scotfree while Fedya had to bear the whole
burden on his shoulders Fancy what he had to go through Its true he
has been reinstated but how could they fail to do that I think there
were not many such gallant sons of the fatherland out there as he And
nowthis duel Have these people no feeling or honor Knowing him to be
an only son to challenge him and shoot so straight Its well God had
mercy on us And what was it for Who doesnt have intrigues nowadays
Why if he was so jealous as I see things he should have shown it
sooner but he lets it go on for months And then to call him out
reckoning on Fedya not fighting because he owed him money What
baseness What meanness I know you understand Fedya my dear count
that believe me is why I am so fond of you Few people do understand
him He is such a lofty heavenly soul

Dlokhov himself during his convalescence spoke to Rostv in a way no
one would have expected of him

I know people consider me a bad man he said Let them I dont care
a straw about anyone but those I love but those I love I love so that
I would give my life for them and the others Id throttle if they stood
in my way I have an adored a priceless mother and two or three
friendsyou among themand as for the rest I only care about them in so
far as they are harmful or useful And most of them are harmful
especially the women Yes dear boy he continued I have met loving
noble highminded men but I have not yet met any womencountesses or
cookswho were not venal I have not yet met that divine purity and
devotion I look for in women If I found such a one Id give my life for
her But those and he made a gesture of contempt And believe me
if I still value my life it is only because I still hope to meet such a
divine creature who will regenerate purify and elevate me But you
dont understand it

Oh yes I quite understand answered Rostv who was under his new
friends influence

In the autumn the Rostvs returned to Moscow Early in the winter
Denisov also came back and stayed with them The first half of the
winter of 1806 which Nicholas Rostv spent in Moscow was one of the
happiest merriest times for him and the whole family Nicholas brought
many young men to his parents house Vra was a handsome girl of
twenty Snya a girl of sixteen with all the charm of an opening flower
Natsha half grown up and half child was now childishly amusing now
girlishly enchanting

At that time in the Rostvs house there prevailed an amorous atmosphere
characteristic of homes where there are very young and very charming
girls Every young man who came to the houseseeing those
impressionable smiling young faces smiling probably at their own
happiness feeling the eager bustle around him and hearing the fitful
bursts of song and music and the inconsequent but friendly prattle of
young girls ready for anything and full of hopeexperienced the same
feeling sharing with the young folk of the Rostvs household a
readiness to fall in love and an expectation of happiness

Among the young men introduced by Rostv one of the first was Dlokhov
whom everyone in the house liked except Natsha She almost quarreled
with her brother about him She insisted that he was a bad man and that
in the duel with Bezkhov Pierre was right and Dlokhov wrong and
further that he was disagreeable and unnatural

Theres nothing for me to understand she cried out with resolute
selfwill he is wicked and heartless There now I like your Denisov
though he is a rake and all that still I like him so you see I do
understand I dont know how to put it with this one everything is
calculated and I dont like that But Denisov

Oh Denisov is quite different replied Nicholas implying that even
Denisov was nothing compared to Dlokhovyou must understand what a
soul there is in Dlokhov you should see him with his mother What a
heart

Well I dont know about that but I am uncomfortable with him And do
you know he has fallen in love with Snya

What nonsense

Im certain of it youll see

Natshas prediction proved true Dlokhov who did not usually care for
the society of ladies began to come often to the house and the
question for whose sake he came though no one spoke of it was soon
settled He came because of Snya And Snya though she would never
have dared to say so knew it and blushed scarlet every time Dlokhov
appeared

Dlokhov often dined at the Rostvs never missed a performance at
which they were present and went to Iogels balls for young people
which the Rostvs always attended He was pointedly attentive to Snya
and looked at her in such a way that not only could she not bear his
glances without coloring but even the old countess and Natsha blushed
when they saw his looks

It was evident that this strange strong man was under the irresistible
influence of the dark graceful girl who loved another

Rostv noticed something new in Dlokhovs relations with Snya but he
did not explain to himself what these new relations were Theyre
always in love with someone he thought of Snya and Natsha But he
was not as much at ease with Snya and Dlokhov as before and was less
frequently at home

In the autumn of 1806 everybody had again begun talking of the war with
Napoleon with even greater warmth than the year before Orders were
given to raise recruits ten men in every thousand for the regular army
and besides this nine men in every thousand for the militia Everywhere
Bonaparte was anathematized and in Moscow nothing but the coming war was
talked of For the Rostv family the whole interest of these
preparations for war lay in the fact that Nicholas would not hear of
remaining in Moscow and only awaited the termination of Denisovs
furlough after Christmas to return with him to their regiment His
approaching departure did not prevent his amusing himself but rather
gave zest to his pleasures He spent the greater part of his time away
from home at dinners parties and balls





CHAPTER XI

On the third day after Christmas Nicholas dined at home a thing he had
rarely done of late It was a grand farewell dinner as he and Denisov
were leaving to join their regiment after Epiphany About twenty people
were present including Dlokhov and Denisov

Never had love been so much in the air and never had the amorous
atmosphere made itself so strongly felt in the Rostvs house as at this
holiday time Seize the moments of happiness love and be loved That
is the only reality in the world all else is folly It is the one thing
we are interested in here said the spirit of the place

Nicholas having as usual exhausted two pairs of horses without
visiting all the places he meant to go to and where he had been invited
returned home just before dinner As soon as he entered he noticed and
felt the tension of the amorous air in the house and also noticed a
curious embarrassment among some of those present Snya Dlokhov and
the old countess were especially disturbed and to a lesser degree
Natsha Nicholas understood that something must have happened between
Snya and Dlokhov before dinner and with the kindly sensitiveness
natural to him was very gentle and wary with them both at dinner On
that same evening there was to be one of the balls that Iogel the
dancing master gave for his pupils during the holidays

Nicholas will you come to Iogels Please do said Natsha He asked
you and Vasli Dmtrich is also going

 Denisov

Where would I not go at the countess command said Denisov who at
the Rostvs had jocularly assumed the role of Natshas knight Im
even weady to dance the pas de chale

If I have time answered Nicholas But I promised the Arkhrovs they
have a party

And you he asked Dlokhov but as soon as he had asked the question
he noticed that it should not have been put

Perhaps coldly and angrily replied Dlokhov glancing at Snya and
scowling he gave Nicholas just such a look as he had given Pierre at
the club dinner

There is something up thought Nicholas and he was further confirmed
in this conclusion by the fact that Dlokhov left immediately after
dinner He called Natsha and asked her what was the matter

And I was looking for you said Natsha running out to him I told
you but you would not believe it she said triumphantly He has
proposed to Snya

Little as Nicholas had occupied himself with Snya of late something
seemed to give way within him at this news Dlokhov was a suitable and
in some respects a brilliant match for the dowerless orphan girl From
the point of view of the old countess and of society it was out of the
question for her to refuse him And therefore Nicholas first feeling on
hearing the news was one of anger with Snya He tried to say
Thats capital of course shell forget her childish promises and
accept the offer but before he had time to say it Natsha began again

And fancy she refused him quite definitely adding after a pause
she told him she loved another

Yes my Snya could not have done otherwise thought Nicholas

Much as Mamma pressed her she refused and I know she wont change
once she has said

And Mamma pressed her said Nicholas reproachfully

Yes said Natsha Do you know Nicholasdont be angrybut I know
you will not marry her I know heaven knows how but I know for certain
that you wont marry her

Now you dont know that at all said Nicholas But I must talk to
her What a darling Snya is he added with a smile

Ah she is indeed a darling Ill send her to you

And Natsha kissed her brother and ran away

A minute later Snya came in with a frightened guilty and scared look
Nicholas went up to her and kissed her hand This was the first time
since his return that they had talked alone and about their love

Sophie he began timidly at first and then more and more boldly if
you wish to refuse one who is not only a brilliant and advantageous
match but a splendid noble fellow he is my friend

Snya interrupted him

I have already refused she said hurriedly

If you are refusing for my sake I am afraid that I

Snya again interrupted She gave him an imploring frightened look

Nicholas dont tell me that she said

No but I must It may be arrogant of me but still it is best to say
it If you refuse him on my account I must tell you the whole truth I
love you and I think I love you more than anyone else

That is enough for me said Snya blushing

No but I have been in love a thousand times and shall fall in love
again though for no one have I such a feeling of friendship
confidence and love as I have for you Then I am young Mamma does not
wish it In a word I make no promise And I beg you to consider
Dlokhovs offer he said articulating his friends name with
difficulty

Dont say that to me I want nothing I love you as a brother and
always shall and I want nothing more

You are an angel I am not worthy of you but I am afraid of misleading
you

And Nicholas again kissed her hand





CHAPTER XII

Iogels were the most enjoyable balls in Moscow So said the mothers as
they watched their young people executing their newly learned steps and
so said the youths and maidens themselves as they danced till they were
ready to drop and so said the grownup young men and women who came to
these balls with an air of condescension and found them most enjoyable
That year two marriages had come of these balls The two pretty young
Princesses Gorchakov met suitors there and were married and so further
increased the fame of these dances What distinguished them from others
was the absence of host or hostess and the presence of the goodnatured
Iogel flying about like a feather and bowing according to the rules of
his art as he collected the tickets from all his visitors There was
the fact that only those came who wished to dance and amuse themselves
as girls of thirteen and fourteen do who are wearing long dresses for
the first time With scarcely any exceptions they all were or seemed to
be prettyso rapturous were their smiles and so sparkling their eyes
Sometimes the best of the pupils of whom Natsha who was exceptionally
graceful was first even danced the pas de chale but at this last ball
only the ecossaise the anglaise and the mazurka which was just coming
into fashion were danced Iogel had taken a ballroom in Bezkhovs
house and the ball as everyone said was a great success There were
many pretty girls and the Rostv girls were among the prettiest They
were both particularly happy and gay That evening proud of Dlokhovs
proposal her refusal and her explanation with Nicholas Snya twirled
about before she left home so that the maid could hardly get her hair
plaited and she was transparently radiant with impulsive joy

Natsha no less proud of her first long dress and of being at a real
ball was even happier They were both dressed in white muslin with pink
ribbons

Natsha fell in love the very moment she entered the ballroom She was
not in love with anyone in particular but with everyone Whatever
person she happened to look at she was in love with for that moment

Oh how delightful it is she kept saying running up to Snya

Nicholas and Denisov were walking up and down looking with kindly
patronage at the dancers

How sweet she isshe will be a weal beauty said Denisov

Who

Countess Natsha answered Denisov

And how she dances What gwace he said again after a pause

Who are you talking about

About your sister ejaculated Denisov testily

Rostv smiled

My dear count you were one of my best pupilsyou must dance said
little Iogel coming up to Nicholas Look how many charming young
ladies He turned with the same request to Denisov who was also a
former pupil of his

No my dear fellow Ill be a wallflower said Denisov Dont you
wecollect what bad use I made of your lessons

Oh no said Iogel hastening to reassure him You were only
inattentive but you had talentoh yes you had talent

The band struck up the newly introduced mazurka Nicholas could not
refuse Iogel and asked Snya to dance Denisov sat down by the old
ladies and leaning on his saber and beating time with his foot told
them something funny and kept them amused while he watched the young
people dancing Iogel with Natsha his pride and his best pupil were
the first couple Noiselessly skillfully stepping with his little feet
in low shoes Iogel flew first across the hall with Natsha who though
shy went on carefully executing her steps Denisov did not take his
eyes off her and beat time with his saber in a way that clearly
indicated that if he was not dancing it was because he would not and not
because he could not In the middle of a figure he beckoned to Rostv
who was passing

This is not at all the thing he said What sort of Polish mazuwka is
this But she does dance splendidly

Knowing that Denisov had a reputation even in Poland for the masterly
way in which he danced the mazurka Nicholas ran up to Natsha

Go and choose Denisov He is a real dancer a wonder he said

When it came to Natshas turn to choose a partner she rose and
tripping rapidly across in her little shoes trimmed with bows ran
timidly to the corner where Denisov sat She saw that everybody was
looking at her and waiting Nicholas saw that Denisov was refusing
though he smiled delightedly He ran up to them

Please Vasli Dmtrich Natsha was saying do come

Oh no let me off Countess Denisov replied

Now then Vaska said Nicholas

They coax me as if I were Vaska the cat said Denisov jokingly

Ill sing for you a whole evening said Natsha

Oh the faiwy She can do anything with me said Denisov and he
unhooked his saber He came out from behind the chairs clasped his
partners hand firmly threw back his head and advanced his foot
waiting for the beat Only on horse back and in the mazurka was
Denisovs short stature not noticeable and he looked the fine fellow he
felt himself to be At the right beat of the music he looked sideways at
his partner with a merry and triumphant air suddenly stamped with one
foot bounded from the floor like a ball and flew round the room taking
his partner with him He glided silently on one foot half across the
room and seeming not to notice the chairs was dashing straight at them
when suddenly clinking his spurs and spreading out his legs he stopped
short on his heels stood so a second stamped on the spot clanking his
spurs whirled rapidly round and striking his left heel against his
right flew round again in a circle Natsha guessed what he meant to
do and abandoning herself to him followed his lead hardly knowing how
First he spun her round holding her now with his left now with his
right hand then falling on one knee he twirled her round him and again
jumping up dashed so impetuously forward that it seemed as if he would
rush through the whole suite of rooms without drawing breath and then
he suddenly stopped and performed some new and unexpected steps When at
last smartly whirling his partner round in front of her chair he drew
up with a click of his spurs and bowed to her Natsha did not even make
him a curtsy She fixed her eyes on him in amazement smiling as if she
did not recognize him

What does this mean she brought out

Although Iogel did not acknowledge this to be the real mazurka everyone
was delighted with Denisovs skill he was asked again and again as a
partner and the old men began smilingly to talk about Poland and the
good old days Denisov flushed after the mazurka and mopping himself
with his handkerchief sat down by Natsha and did not leave her for the
rest of the evening





CHAPTER XIII

For two days after that Rostv did not see Dlokhov at his own or at
Dlokhovs home on the third day he received a note from him

As I do not intend to be at your house again for reasons you know of
and am going to rejoin my regiment I am giving a farewell supper
tonight to my friendscome to the English Hotel

About ten oclock Rostv went to the English Hotel straight from the
theater where he had been with his family and Denisov He was at once
shown to the best room which Dlokhov had taken for that evening Some
twenty men were gathered round a table at which Dlokhov sat between two
candles On the table was a pile of gold and paper money and he was
keeping the bank Rostv had not seen him since his proposal and Snyas
refusal and felt uncomfortable at the thought of how they would meet

Dlokhovs clear cold glance met Rostv as soon as he entered the door
as though he had long expected him

Its a long time since we met he said Thanks for coming Ill just
finish dealing and then Ilyushka will come with his chorus

I called once or twice at your house said Rostv reddening

Dlokhov made no reply

You may punt he said

Rostv recalled at that moment a strange conversation he had once had
with Dlokhov None but fools trust to luck in play Dlokhov had then
said

Or are you afraid to play with me Dlokhov now asked as if guessing
Rostvs thought

Beneath his smile Rostv saw in him the mood he had shown at the club
dinner and at other times when as if tired of everyday life he had felt
a need to escape from it by some strange and usually cruel action

Rostv felt ill at ease He tried but failed to find some joke with
which to reply to Dlokhovs words But before he had thought of
anything Dlokhov looking straight in his face said slowly and
deliberately so that everyone could hear

Do you remember we had a talk about cards Hes a fool who trusts to
luck one should make certain and I want to try

To try his luck or the certainty Rostv asked himself

Well youd better not play Dlokhov added and springing a new pack
of cards said Bank gentlemen

Moving the money forward he prepared to deal Rostv sat down by his
side and at first did not play Dlokhov kept glancing at him

Why dont you play he asked

And strange to say Nicholas felt that he could not help taking up a
card putting a small stake on it and beginning to play

I have no money with me he said

Ill trust you

Rostv staked five rubles on a card and lost staked again and again
lost Dlokhov killed that is beat ten cards of Rostvs running

Gentlemen said Dlokhov after he had dealt for some time Please
place your money on the cards or I may get muddled in the reckoning

One of the players said he hoped he might be trusted

Yes you might but I am afraid of getting the accounts mixed So I ask
you to put the money on your cards replied Dlokhov Dont stint
yourself well settle afterwards he added turning to Rostv

The game continued a waiter kept handing round champagne

All Rostvs cards were beaten and he had eight hundred rubles scored up
against him He wrote 800 rubles on a card but while the waiter
filled his glass he changed his mind and altered it to his usual stake
of twenty rubles

Leave it said Dlokhov though he did not seem to be even looking at
Rostv youll win it back all the sooner I lose to the others but win
from you Or are you afraid of me he asked again

Rostv submitted He let the eight hundred remain and laid down a seven
of hearts with a torn corner which he had picked up from the floor He
well remembered that seven afterwards He laid down the seven of hearts
on which with a broken bit of chalk he had written 800 rubles in clear
upright figures he emptied the glass of warm champagne that was handed
him smiled at Dlokhovs words and with a sinking heart waiting for a
seven to turn up gazed at Dlokhovs hands which held the pack Much
depended on Rostvs winning or losing on that seven of hearts On the
previous Sunday the old count had given his son two thousand rubles and
though he always disliked speaking of money difficulties had told
Nicholas that this was all he could let him have till May and asked him
to be more economical this time Nicholas had replied that it would be
more than enough for him and that he gave his word of honor not to take
anything more till the spring Now only twelve hundred rubles was left
of that money so that this seven of hearts meant for him not only the
loss of sixteen hundred rubles but the necessity of going back on his
word With a sinking heart he watched Dlokhovs hands and thought Now
then make haste and let me have this card and Ill take my cap and
drive home to supper with Denisov Natsha and Snya and will
certainly never touch a card again At that moment his home life jokes
with Ptya talks with Snya duets with Natsha piquet with his
father and even his comfortable bed in the house on the Povarskya rose
before him with such vividness clearness and charm that it seemed as
if it were all a lost and unappreciated bliss long past He could not
conceive that a stupid chance letting the seven be dealt to the right
rather than to the left might deprive him of all this happiness newly
appreciated and newly illumined and plunge him into the depths of
unknown and undefined misery That could not be yet he awaited with a
sinking heart the movement of Dlokhovs hands Those broad reddish
hands with hairy wrists visible from under the shirt cuffs laid down
the pack and took up a glass and a pipe that were handed him

So you are not afraid to play with me repeated Dlokhov and as if
about to tell a good story he put down the cards leaned back in his
chair and began deliberately with a smile

Yes gentlemen Ive been told theres a rumor going about Moscow that
Im a sharper so I advise you to be careful

Come now deal exclaimed Rostv

Oh those Moscow gossips said Dlokhov and he took up the cards with
a smile

Aah Rostv almost screamed lifting both hands to his head The seven
he needed was lying uppermost the first card in the pack He had lost
more than he could pay

Still dont ruin yourself said Dlokhov with a side glance at Rostv
as he continued to deal





CHAPTER XIV

An hour and a half later most of the players were but little interested
in their own play

The whole interest was concentrated on Rostv Instead of sixteen
hundred rubles he had a long column of figures scored against him which
he had reckoned up to ten thousand but that now as he vaguely
supposed must have risen to fifteen thousand In reality it already
exceeded twenty thousand rubles Dlokhov was no longer listening to
stories or telling them but followed every movement of Rostvs hands
and occasionally ran his eyes over the score against him He had decided
to play until that score reached fortythree thousand He had fixed on
that number because fortythree was the sum of his and Snyas joint
ages Rostv leaning his head on both hands sat at the table which was
scrawled over with figures wet with spilled wine and littered with
cards One tormenting impression did not leave him that those broad
boned reddish hands with hairy wrists visible from under the shirt
sleeves those hands which he loved and hated held him in their power

Six hundred rubles ace a corner a nine winning it backs
impossible Oh how pleasant it was at home The knave double or
quits it cant be And why is he doing this to me Rostv
pondered Sometimes he staked a large sum but Dlokhov refused to
accept it and fixed the stake himself Nicholas submitted to him and at
one moment prayed to God as he had done on the battlefield at the bridge
over the Enns and then guessed that the card that came first to hand
from the crumpled heap under the table would save him now counted the
cords on his coat and took a card with that number and tried staking the
total of his losses on it then he looked round for aid from the other
players or peered at the now cold face of Dlokhov and tried to read
what was passing in his mind

He knows of course what this loss means to me He cant want my ruin
Wasnt he my friend Wasnt I fond of him But its not his fault
Whats he to do if he has such luck And its not my fault either
he thought to himself I have done nothing wrong Have I killed anyone
or insulted or wished harm to anyone Why such a terrible misfortune
And when did it begin Such a little while ago I came to this table with
the thought of winning a hundred rubles to buy that casket for Mammas
name day and then going home I was so happy so free so lighthearted
And I did not realize how happy I was When did that end and when did
this new terrible state of things begin What marked the change I sat
all the time in this same place at this table chose and placed cards
and watched those broadboned agile hands in the same way When did it
happen and what has happened I am well and strong and still the same
and in the same place No it cant be Surely it will all end in
nothing

He was flushed and bathed in perspiration though the room was not hot
His face was terrible and piteous to see especially from its helpless
efforts to seem calm

The score against him reached the fateful sum of fortythree thousand
Rostv had just prepared a card by bending the corner of which he meant
to double the three thousand just put down to his score when Dlokhov
slamming down the pack of cards put it aside and began rapidly adding
up the total of Rostvs debt breaking the chalk as he marked the
figures in his clear bold hand

Supper its time for supper And here are the gypsies

Some swarthy men and women were really entering from the cold outside
and saying something in their gypsy accents Nicholas understood that it
was all over but he said in an indifferent tone

Well wont you go on I had a splendid card all ready as if it were
the fun of the game which interested him most

Its all up Im lost thought he Now a bullet through my
brainthats all thats left me And at the same time he said in a
cheerful voice

Come now just this one more little card

All right said Dlokhov having finished the addition All right
Twentyone rubles he said pointing to the figure twentyone by which
the total exceeded the round sum of fortythree thousand and taking up
a pack he prepared to deal Rostv submissively unbent the corner of his
card and instead of the six thousand he had intended carefully wrote
twentyone

Its all the same to me he said I only want to see whether you will
let me win this ten or beat it

Dlokhov began to deal seriously Oh how Rostv detested at that moment
those hands with their short reddish fingers and hairy wrists which
held him in their power The ten fell to him

You owe fortythree thousand Count said Dlokhov and stretching
himself he rose from the table One does get tired sitting so long he
added

Yes Im tired too said Rostv

Dlokhov cut him short as if to remind him that it was not for him to
jest

When am I to receive the money Count

Rostv flushing drew Dlokhov into the next room

I cannot pay it all immediately Will you take an IOU he said

I say Rostv said Dlokhov clearly smiling and looking Nicholas
straight in the eyes you know the saying Lucky in love unlucky at
cards Your cousin is in love with you I know

Oh its terrible to feel oneself so in this mans power thought
Rostv He knew what a shock he would inflict on his father and mother
by the news of this loss he knew what a relief it would be to escape it
all and felt that Dlokhov knew that he could save him from all this
shame and sorrow but wanted now to play with him as a cat does with a
mouse

Your cousin Dlokhov started to say but Nicholas interrupted him

My cousin has nothing to do with this and its not necessary to mention
her he exclaimed fiercely

Then when am I to have it

Tomorrow replied Rostv and left the room





CHAPTER XV

To say tomorrow and keep up a dignified tone was not difficult but to
go home alone see his sisters brother mother and father confess and
ask for money he had no right to after giving his word of honor was
terrible

At home they had not yet gone to bed The young people after returning
from the theater had had supper and were grouped round the clavichord
As soon as Nicholas entered he was enfolded in that poetic atmosphere
of love which pervaded the Rostv household that winter and now after
Dlokhovs proposal and Iogels ball seemed to have grown thicker round
Snya and Natsha as the air does before a thunderstorm Snya and
Natsha in the lightblue dresses they had worn at the theater looking
pretty and conscious of it were standing by the clavichord happy and
smiling Vra was playing chess with Shinshn in the drawing room The
old countess waiting for the return of her husband and son sat playing
patience with the old gentlewoman who lived in their house Denisov
with sparkling eyes and ruffled hair sat at the clavichord striking
chords with his short fingers his legs thrown back and his eyes rolling
as he sang with his small husky but true voice some verses called
Enchantress which he had composed and to which he was trying to fit
music

Enchantress say to my forsaken lyre What magic power is this recalls
me still What spark has set my inmost soul on fire What is this bliss
that makes my fingers thrill

He was singing in passionate tones gazing with his sparkling black
agate eyes at the frightened and happy Natsha

Splendid Excellent exclaimed Natsha Another verse she said
without noticing Nicholas

Everythings still the same with them thought Nicholas glancing into
the drawing room where he saw Vra and his mother with the old lady

Ah and heres Nicholas cried Natsha running up to him

Is Papa at home he asked

I am so glad youve come said Natsha without answering him We are
enjoying ourselves Vasli Dmtrich is staying a day longer for my sake
Did you know

No Papa is not back yet said Snya

Nicholas have you come Come here dear called the old countess from
the drawing room

Nicholas went to her kissed her hand and sitting down silently at her
table began to watch her hands arranging the cards From the dancing
room they still heard the laughter and merry voices trying to persuade
Natsha to sing

All wight All wight shouted Denisov Its no good making excuses
now Its your turn to sing the bacawollaI entweat you

The countess glanced at her silent son

What is the matter she asked

Oh nothing said he as if weary of being continually asked the same
question Will Papa be back soon

I expect so

Everythings the same with them They know nothing about it Where am I
to go thought Nicholas and went again into the dancing room where the
clavichord stood

Snya was sitting at the clavichord playing the prelude to Denisovs
favorite barcarolle Natsha was preparing to sing Denisov was looking
at her with enraptured eyes

Nicholas began pacing up and down the room

Why do they want to make her sing How can she sing Theres nothing to
be happy about thought he

Snya struck the first chord of the prelude

My God Im a ruined and dishonored man A bullet through my brain is
the only thing left menot singing his thoughts ran on Go away But
where to Its onelet them sing

He continued to pace the room looking gloomily at Denisov and the girls
and avoiding their eyes

Nikolenka what is the matter Snyas eyes fixed on him seemed to
ask She noticed at once that something had happened to him

Nicholas turned away from her Natsha too with her quick instinct had
instantly noticed her brothers condition But though she noticed it
she was herself in such high spirits at that moment so far from sorrow
sadness or selfreproach that she purposely deceived herself as young
people often do No I am too happy now to spoil my enjoyment by
sympathy with anyones sorrow she felt and she said to herself No
I must be mistaken he must be feeling happy just as I am

Now Snya she said going to the very middle of the room where she
considered the resonance was best

Having lifted her head and let her arms droop lifelessly as ballet
dancers do Natsha rising energetically from her heels to her toes
stepped to the middle of the room and stood still

Yes thats me she seemed to say answering the rapt gaze with which
Denisov followed her

And what is she so pleased about thought Nicholas looking at his
sister Why isnt she dull and ashamed

Natsha took the first note her throat swelled her chest rose her
eyes became serious At that moment she was oblivious of her
surroundings and from her smiling lips flowed sounds which anyone may
produce at the same intervals and hold for the same time but which
leave you cold a thousand times and the thousand and first time thrill
you and make you weep

Natsha that winter had for the first time begun to sing seriously
mainly because Denisov so delighted in her singing She no longer sang
as a child there was no longer in her singing that comical childish
painstaking effect that had been in it before but she did not yet sing
well as all the connoisseurs who heard her said It is not trained
but it is a beautiful voice that must be trained Only they generally
said this some time after she had finished singing While that untrained
voice with its incorrect breathing and labored transitions was
sounding even the connoisseurs said nothing but only delighted in it
and wished to hear it again In her voice there was a virginal
freshness an unconsciousness of her own powers and an as yet untrained
velvety softness which so mingled with her lack of art in singing that
it seemed as if nothing in that voice could be altered without spoiling
it

What is this thought Nicholas listening to her with widely opened
eyes What has happened to her How she is singing today And suddenly
the whole world centered for him on anticipation of the next note the
next phrase and everything in the world was divided into three beats
Oh mio crudele affetto One two three one two three
One Oh mio crudele affetto One two three One Oh this
senseless life of ours thought Nicholas All this misery and money
and Dlokhov and anger and honorits all nonsense but this is
real Now then Natsha now then dearest Now then darling How
will she take that si Shes taken it Thank God And without noticing
that he was singing to strengthen the si he sung a second a third
below the high note Ah God How fine Did I really take it How
fortunate he thought

Oh how that chord vibrated and how moved was something that was finest
in Rostvs soul And this something was apart from everything else in
the world and above everything in the world What were losses and
Dlokhov and words of honor All nonsense One might kill and rob
and yet be happy





CHAPTER XVI

It was long since Rostv had felt such enjoyment from music as he did
that day But no sooner had Natsha finished her barcarolle than reality
again presented itself He got up without saying a word and went
downstairs to his own room A quarter of an hour later the old count
came in from his club cheerful and contented Nicholas hearing him
drive up went to meet him

Wellhad a good time said the old count smiling gaily and proudly at
his son

Nicholas tried to say Yes but could not and he nearly burst into
sobs The count was lighting his pipe and did not notice his sons
condition

Ah it cant be avoided thought Nicholas for the first and last
time And suddenly in the most casual tone which made him feel ashamed
of himself he said as if merely asking his father to let him have the
carriage to drive to town

Papa I have come on a matter of business I was nearly forgetting I
need some money

Dear me said his father who was in a specially good humor I told
you it would not be enough How much

Very much said Nicholas flushing and with a stupid careless smile
for which he was long unable to forgive himself I have lost a little
I mean a good deal a great dealforty three thousand

What To whom Nonsense cried the count suddenly reddening with
an apoplectic flush over neck and nape as old people do

I promised to pay tomorrow said Nicholas

Well said the old count spreading out his arms and sinking
helplessly on the sofa

It cant be helped It happens to everyone said the son with a bold
free and easy tone while in his soul he regarded himself as a
worthless scoundrel whose whole life could not atone for his crime He
longed to kiss his fathers hands and kneel to beg his forgiveness but
said in a careless and even rude voice that it happens to everyone

The old count cast down his eyes on hearing his sons words and began
bustlingly searching for something

Yes yes he muttered it will be difficult I fear difficult to
raise happens to everybody Yes who has not done it

And with a furtive glance at his sons face the count went out of the
room Nicholas had been prepared for resistance but had not at all
expected this

Papa Papa he called after him sobbing forgive me And seizing
his fathers hand he pressed it to his lips and burst into tears

While father and son were having their explanation the mother and
daughter were having one not less important Natsha came running to her
mother quite excited

Mamma Mamma He has made me

Made what

Made made me an offer Mamma Mamma she exclaimed

The countess did not believe her ears Denisov had proposed To whom To
this chit of a girl Natsha who not so long ago was playing with dolls
and who was still having lessons

Dont Natsha What nonsense she said hoping it was a joke

Nonsense indeed I am telling you the fact said Natsha indignantly
I come to ask you what to do and you call it nonsense

The countess shrugged her shoulders

If it is true that Monsieur Denisov has made you a proposal tell him
he is a fool thats all

No hes not a fool replied Natsha indignantly and seriously

Well then what do you want Youre all in love nowadays Well if you
are in love marry him said the countess with a laugh of annoyance
Good luck to you

No Mamma Im not in love with him I suppose Im not in love with
him

Well then tell him so

Mamma are you cross Dont be cross dear Is it my fault

No but what is it my dear Do you want me to go and tell him said
the countess smiling

No I will do it myself only tell me what to say Its all very well
for you said Natsha with a responsive smile You should have seen
how he said it I know he did not mean to say it but it came out
accidently

Well all the same you must refuse him

No I mustnt I am so sorry for him Hes so nice

Well then accept his offer Its high time for you to be married
answered the countess sharply and sarcastically

No Mamma but Im so sorry for him I dont know how Im to say it

And theres nothing for you to say I shall speak to him myself said
the countess indignant that they should have dared to treat this little
Natsha as grown up

No not on any account I will tell him myself and youll listen at
the door and Natsha ran across the drawing room to the dancing hall
where Denisov was sitting on the same chair by the clavichord with his
face in his hands

He jumped up at the sound of her light step

Nataly he said moving with rapid steps toward her decide my fate
It is in your hands

Vasli Dmtrich Im so sorry for you No but you are so nice
but it wont donot that but as a friend I shall always love you

Denisov bent over her hand and she heard strange sounds she did not
understand She kissed his rough curly black head At this instant they
heard the quick rustle of the countess dress She came up to them

Vasli Dmtrich I thank you for the honor she said with an
embarrassed voice though it sounded severe to Denisovbut my daughter
is so young and I thought that as my sons friend you would have
addressed yourself first to me In that case you would not have obliged
me to give this refusal

Countess said Denisov with downcast eyes and a guilty face He
tried to say more but faltered

Natsha could not remain calm seeing him in such a plight She began to
sob aloud

Countess I have done wong Denisov went on in an unsteady voice
but believe me I so adore your daughter and all your family that I
would give my life twice over He looked at the countess and seeing
her severe face said Well goodby Countess and kissing her hand
he left the room with quick resolute strides without looking at
Natsha

Next day Rostv saw Denisov off He did not wish to stay another day in
Moscow All Denisovs Moscow friends gave him a farewell entertainment
at the gypsies with the result that he had no recollection of how he
was put in the sleigh or of the first three stages of his journey

After Denisovs departure Rostv spent another fortnight in Moscow
without going out of the house waiting for the money his father could
not at once raise and he spent most of his time in the girls room

Snya was more tender and devoted to him than ever It was as if she
wanted to show him that his losses were an achievement that made her
love him all the more but Nicholas now considered himself unworthy of
her

He filled the girls albums with verses and music and having at last
sent Dlokhov the whole fortythree thousand rubles and received his
receipt he left at the end of November without taking leave of any of
his acquaintances to overtake his regiment which was already in Poland





BOOK FIVE 1806 07





CHAPTER I

After his interview with his wife Pierre left for Petersburg At the
Torzhok post station either there were no horses or the postmaster
would not supply them Pierre was obliged to wait Without undressing
he lay down on the leather sofa in front of a round table put his big
feet in their overboots on the table and began to reflect

Will you have the portmanteaus brought in And a bed got ready and
tea asked his valet

Pierre gave no answer for he neither heard nor saw anything He had
begun to think of the last station and was still pondering on the same
questionone so important that he took no notice of what went on around
him Not only was he indifferent as to whether he got to Petersburg
earlier or later or whether he secured accommodation at this station
but compared to the thoughts that now occupied him it was a matter of
indifference whether he remained there for a few hours or for the rest
of his life

The postmaster his wife the valet and a peasant woman selling Torzhok
embroidery came into the room offering their services Without changing
his careless attitude Pierre looked at them over his spectacles unable
to understand what they wanted or how they could go on living without
having solved the problems that so absorbed him He had been engrossed
by the same thoughts ever since the day he returned from Sokolniki after
the duel and had spent that first agonizing sleepless night But now
in the solitude of the journey they seized him with special force No
matter what he thought about he always returned to these same questions
which he could not solve and yet could not cease to ask himself It was
as if the thread of the chief screw which held his life together were
stripped so that the screw could not get in or out but went on turning
uselessly in the same place

The postmaster came in and began obsequiously to beg his excellency to
wait only two hours when come what might he would let his excellency
have the courier horses It was plain that he was lying and only wanted
to get more money from the traveler

Is this good or bad Pierre asked himself It is good for me bad for
another traveler and for himself its unavoidable because he needs
money for food the man said an officer had once given him a thrashing
for letting a private traveler have the courier horses But the officer
thrashed him because he had to get on as quickly as possible And I
continued Pierre shot Dlokhov because I considered myself injured
and Louis XVI was executed because they considered him a criminal and a
year later they executed those who executed himalso for some reason
What is bad What is good What should one love and what hate What does
one live for And what am I What is life and what is death What power
governs all

There was no answer to any of these questions except one and that not
a logical answer and not at all a reply to them The answer was Youll
die and all will end Youll die and know all or cease asking But
dying was also dreadful

The Torzhok peddler woman in a whining voice went on offering her
wares especially a pair of goatskin slippers I have hundreds of
rubles I dont know what to do with and she stands in her tattered
cloak looking timidly at me he thought And what does she want the
money for As if that money could add a hairs breadth to happiness or
peace of mind Can anything in the world make her or me less a prey to
evil and deathdeath which ends all and must come today or tomorrowat
any rate in an instant as compared with eternity And again he twisted
the screw with the stripped thread and again it turned uselessly in the
same place

His servant handed him a halfcut novel in the form of letters by
Madame de Souza He began reading about the sufferings and virtuous
struggles of a certain Emilie de Mansfeld And why did she resist her
seducer when she loved him he thought God could not have put into
her heart an impulse that was against His will My wifeas she once
wasdid not struggle and perhaps she was right Nothing has been found
out nothing discovered Pierre again said to himself All we can know
is that we know nothing And thats the height of human wisdom

Everything within and around him seemed confused senseless and
repellent Yet in this very repugnance to all his circumstances Pierre
found a kind of tantalizing satisfaction

I make bold to ask your excellency to move a little for this
gentleman said the postmaster entering the room followed by another
traveler also detained for lack of horses

The newcomer was a short largeboned yellowfaced wrinkled old man
with gray bushy eyebrows overhanging bright eyes of an indefinite
grayish color

Pierre took his feet off the table stood up and lay down on a bed that
had been got ready for him glancing now and then at the newcomer who
with a gloomy and tired face was wearily taking off his wraps with the
aid of his servant and not looking at Pierre With a pair of felt boots
on his thin bony legs and keeping on a worn nankeencovered sheepskin
coat the traveler sat down on the sofa leaned back his big head with
its broad temples and closecropped hair and looked at Bezkhov The
stern shrewd and penetrating expression of that look struck Pierre He
felt a wish to speak to the stranger but by the time he had made up his
mind to ask him a question about the roads the traveler had closed his
eyes His shriveled old hands were folded and on the finger of one of
them Pierre noticed a large cast iron ring with a seal representing a
deaths head The stranger sat without stirring either resting or as
it seemed to Pierre sunk in profound and calm meditation His servant
was also a yellow wrinkled old man without beard or mustache
evidently not because he was shaven but because they had never grown
This active old servant was unpacking the travelers canteen and
preparing tea He brought in a boiling samovar When everything was
ready the stranger opened his eyes moved to the table filled a
tumbler with tea for himself and one for the beardless old man to whom
he passed it Pierre began to feel a sense of uneasiness and the need
even the inevitability of entering into conversation with this
stranger

The servant brought back his tumbler turned upside down with an
unfinished bit of nibbled sugar and asked if anything more would be
wanted

 To indicate he did not want more tea

No Give me the book said the stranger

The servant handed him a book which Pierre took to be a devotional work
and the traveler became absorbed in it Pierre looked at him All at
once the stranger closed the book putting in a marker and again
leaning with his arms on the back of the sofa sat in his former
position with his eyes shut Pierre looked at him and had not time to
turn away when the old man opening his eyes fixed his steady and
severe gaze straight on Pierres face

Pierre felt confused and wished to avoid that look but the bright old
eyes attracted him irresistibly





CHAPTER II

I have the pleasure of addressing Count Bezkhov if I am not
mistaken said the stranger in a deliberate and loud voice

Pierre looked silently and inquiringly at him over his spectacles

I have heard of you my dear sir continued the stranger and of your
misfortune He seemed to emphasize the last word as if to sayYes
misfortune Call it what you please I know that what happened to you in
Moscow was a misfortuneI regret it very much my dear sir

Pierre flushed and hurriedly putting his legs down from the bed bent
forward toward the old man with a forced and timid smile

I have not referred to this out of curiosity my dear sir but for
greater reasons

He paused his gaze still on Pierre and moved aside on the sofa by way
of inviting the other to take a seat beside him Pierre felt reluctant
to enter into conversation with this old man but submitting to him
involuntarily came up and sat down beside him

You are unhappy my dear sir the stranger continued You are young
and I am old I should like to help you as far as lies in my power

Oh yes said Pierre with a forced smile I am very grateful to you
Where are you traveling from

The strangers face was not genial it was even cold and severe but in
spite of this both the face and words of his new acquaintance were
irresistibly attractive to Pierre

But if for reason you dont feel inclined to talk to me said the old
man say so my dear sir And he suddenly smiled in an unexpected and
tenderly paternal way

Oh no not at all On the contrary I am very glad to make your
acquaintance said Pierre And again glancing at the strangers hands
he looked more closely at the ring with its skulla masonic sign

Allow me to ask he said are you a Mason

Yes I belong to the Brotherhood of the Freemasons said the stranger
looking deeper and deeper into Pierres eyes And in their name and my
own I hold out a brotherly hand to you

I am afraid said Pierre smiling and wavering between the confidence
the personality of the Freemason inspired in him and his own habit of
ridiculing the masonic beliefsI am afraid I am very far from
understandinghow am I to put itI am afraid my way of looking at the
world is so opposed to yours that we shall not understand one another

I know your outlook said the Mason and the view of life you
mention and which you think is the result of your own mental efforts
is the one held by the majority of people and is the invariable fruit
of pride indolence and ignorance Forgive me my dear sir but if I
had not known it I should not have addressed you Your view of life is a
regrettable delusion

Just as I may suppose you to be deluded said Pierre with a faint
smile

I should never dare to say that I know the truth said the Mason
whose words struck Pierre more and more by their precision and firmness
No one can attain to truth by himself Only by laying stone on stone
with the cooperation of all by the millions of generations from our
forefather Adam to our own times is that temple reared which is to be a
worthy dwelling place of the Great God he added and closed his eyes

I ought to tell you that I do not believe do not believe in God
said Pierre regretfully and with an effort feeling it essential to
speak the whole truth

The Mason looked intently at Pierre and smiled as a rich man with
millions in hand might smile at a poor fellow who told him that he poor
man had not the five rubles that would make him happy

Yes you do not know Him my dear sir said the Mason You cannot
know Him You do not know Him and that is why you are unhappy

Yes yes I am unhappy assented Pierre But what am I to do

You know Him not my dear sir and so you are very unhappy You do not
know Him but He is here He is in me He is in my words He is in thee
and even in those blasphemous words thou hast just uttered pronounced
the Mason in a stern and tremulous voice

He paused and sighed evidently trying to calm himself

If He were not he said quietly you and I would not be speaking of
Him my dear sir Of what of whom are we speaking Whom hast thou
denied he suddenly asked with exulting austerity and authority in his
voice Who invented Him if He did not exist Whence came thy
conception of the existence of such an incomprehensible Being didst
thou and why did the whole world conceive the idea of the existence of
such an incomprehensible Being a Being allpowerful eternal and
infinite in all His attributes

He stopped and remained silent for a long time

Pierre could not and did not wish to break this silence

He exists but to understand Him is hard the Mason began again
looking not at Pierre but straight before him and turning the leaves of
his book with his old hands which from excitement he could not keep
still If it were a man whose existence thou didst doubt I could bring
him to thee could take him by the hand and show him to thee But how
can I an insignificant mortal show His omnipotence His infinity and
all His mercy to one who is blind or who shuts his eyes that he may not
see or understand Him and may not see or understand his own vileness and
sinfulness He paused again Who art thou Thou dreamest that thou art
wise because thou couldst utter those blasphemous words he went on
with a somber and scornful smile And thou art more foolish and
unreasonable than a little child who playing with the parts of a
skillfully made watch dares to say that as he does not understand its
use he does not believe in the master who made it To know Him is
hard For ages from our forefather Adam to our own day we labor to
attain that knowledge and are still infinitely far from our aim but in
our lack of understanding we see only our weakness and His
greatness

Pierre listened with swelling heart gazing into the Masons face with
shining eyes not interrupting or questioning him but believing with
his whole soul what the stranger said Whether he accepted the wise
reasoning contained in the Masons words or believed as a child
believes in the speakers tone of conviction and earnestness or the
tremor of the speakers voicewhich sometimes almost brokeor those
brilliant aged eyes grown old in this conviction or the calm firmness
and certainty of his vocation which radiated from his whole being and
which struck Pierre especially by contrast with his own dejection and
hopelessnessat any rate Pierre longed with his whole soul to believe
and he did believe and felt a joyful sense of comfort regeneration
and return to life

He is not to be apprehended by reason but by life said the Mason

I do not understand said Pierre feeling with dismay doubts
reawakening He was afraid of any want of clearness any weakness in
the Masons arguments he dreaded not to be able to believe in him I
dont understand he said how it is that the mind of man cannot
attain the knowledge of which you speak

The Mason smiled with his gentle fatherly smile

The highest wisdom and truth are like the purest liquid we may wish to
imbibe he said Can I receive that pure liquid into an impure vessel
and judge of its purity Only by the inner purification of myself can I
retain in some degree of purity the liquid I receive

Yes yes that is so said Pierre joyfully

The highest wisdom is not founded on reason alone not on those worldly
sciences of physics history chemistry and the like into which
intellectual knowledge is divided The highest wisdom is one The
highest wisdom has but one sciencethe science of the wholethe science
explaining the whole creation and mans place in it To receive that
science it is necessary to purify and renew ones inner self and so
before one can know it is necessary to believe and to perfect ones
self And to attain this end we have the light called conscience that
God has implanted in our souls

Yes yes assented Pierre

Look then at thy inner self with the eyes of the spirit and ask
thyself whether thou art content with thyself What hast thou attained
relying on reason only What art thou You are young you are rich you
are clever you are well educated And what have you done with all these
good gifts Are you content with yourself and with your life

No I hate my life Pierre muttered wincing

Thou hatest it Then change it purify thyself and as thou art
purified thou wilt gain wisdom Look at your life my dear sir How
have you spent it In riotous orgies and debauchery receiving
everything from society and giving nothing in return You have become
the possessor of wealth How have you used it What have you done for
your neighbor Have you ever thought of your tens of thousands of
slaves Have you helped them physically and morally No You have
profited by their toil to lead a profligate life That is what you have
done Have you chosen a post in which you might be of service to your
neighbor No You have spent your life in idleness Then you married my
dear sirtook on yourself responsibility for the guidance of a young
woman and what have you done You have not helped her to find the way
of truth my dear sir but have thrust her into an abyss of deceit and
misery A man offended you and you shot him and you say you do not know
God and hate your life There is nothing strange in that my dear sir

After these words the Mason as if tired by his long discourse again
leaned his arms on the back of the sofa and closed his eyes Pierre
looked at that aged stern motionless almost lifeless face and moved
his lips without uttering a sound He wished to say Yes a vile idle
vicious life but dared not break the silence

The Mason cleared his throat huskily as old men do and called his
servant

How about the horses he asked without looking at Pierre

The exchange horses have just come answered the servant Will you
not rest here

No tell them to harness

Can he really be going away leaving me alone without having told me
all and without promising to help me thought Pierre rising with
downcast head and he began to pace the room glancing occasionally at
the Mason Yes I never thought of it but I have led a contemptible
and profligate life though I did not like it and did not want to
thought Pierre But this man knows the truth and if he wished to
could disclose it to me

Pierre wished to say this to the Mason but did not dare to The
traveler having packed his things with his practiced hands began
fastening his coat When he had finished he turned to Bezkhov and
said in a tone of indifferent politeness

Where are you going to now my dear sir

I Im going to Petersburg answered Pierre in a childlike
hesitating voice I thank you I agree with all you have said But do
not suppose me to be so bad With my whole soul I wish to be what you
would have me be but I have never had help from anyone But it is I
above all who am to blame for everything Help me teach me and
perhaps I may

Pierre could not go on He gulped and turned away

The Mason remained silent for a long time evidently considering

Help comes from God alone he said but such measure of help as our
Order can bestow it will render you my dear sir You are going to
Petersburg Hand this to Count Willarski he took out his notebook and
wrote a few words on a large sheet of paper folded in four Allow me
to give you a piece of advice When you reach the capital first of all
devote some time to solitude and selfexamination and do not resume your
former way of life And now I wish you a good journey my dear sir he
added seeing that his servant had entered and success

The traveler was Joseph Alexeevich Bazdeev as Pierre saw from the
postmasters book Bazdeev had been one of the bestknown Freemasons and
Martinists even in Novikovs time For a long while after he had gone
Pierre did not go to bed or order horses but paced up and down the room
pondering over his vicious past and with a rapturous sense of beginning
anew pictured to himself the blissful irreproachable virtuous future
that seemed to him so easy It seemed to him that he had been vicious
only because he had somehow forgotten how good it is to be virtuous Not
a trace of his former doubts remained in his soul He firmly believed in
the possibility of the brotherhood of men united in the aim of
supporting one another in the path of virtue and that is how
Freemasonry presented itself to him





CHAPTER III

On reaching Petersburg Pierre did not let anyone know of his arrival he
went nowhere and spent whole days in reading Thomas a Kempis whose book
had been sent him by someone unknown One thing he continually realized
as he read that book the joy hitherto unknown to him of believing in
the possibility of attaining perfection and in the possibility of
active brotherly love among men which Joseph Alexeevich had revealed to
him A week after his arrival the young Polish count Willarski whom
Pierre had known slightly in Petersburg society came into his room one
evening in the official and ceremonious manner in which Dlokhovs
second had called on him and having closed the door behind him and
satisfied himself that there was nobody else in the room addressed
Pierre

I have come to you with a message and an offer Count he said without
sitting down A person of very high standing in our Brotherhood has
made application for you to be received into our Order before the usual
term and has proposed to me to be your sponsor I consider it a sacred
duty to fulfill that persons wishes Do you wish to enter the
Brotherhood of Freemasons under my sponsorship

The cold austere tone of this man whom he had almost always before met
at balls amiably smiling in the society of the most brilliant women
surprised Pierre

Yes I do wish it said he

Willarski bowed his head

One more question Count he said which I beg you to answer in all
sinceritynot as a future Mason but as an honest man have you renounced
your former convictionsdo you believe in God

Pierre considered

Yes yes I believe in God he said

In that case began Willarski but Pierre interrupted him

Yes I do believe in God he repeated

In that case we can go said Willarski My carriage is at your
service

Willarski was silent throughout the drive To Pierres inquiries as to
what he must do and how he should answer Willarski only replied that
brothers more worthy than he would test him and that Pierre had only to
tell the truth

Having entered the courtyard of a large house where the Lodge had its
headquarters and having ascended a dark staircase they entered a small
welllit anteroom where they took off their cloaks without the aid of a
servant From there they passed into another room A man in strange
attire appeared at the door Willarski stepping toward him said
something to him in French in an undertone and then went up to a small
wardrobe in which Pierre noticed garments such as he had never seen
before Having taken a kerchief from the cupboard Willarski bound
Pierres eyes with it and tied it in a knot behind catching some hairs
painfully in the knot Then he drew his face down kissed him and
taking him by the hand led him forward The hairs tied in the knot hurt
Pierre and there were lines of pain on his face and a shamefaced smile
His huge figure with arms hanging down and with a puckered though
smiling face moved after Willarski with uncertain timid steps

Having led him about ten paces Willarski stopped

Whatever happens to you he said you must bear it all manfully if
you have firmly resolved to join our Brotherhood Pierre nodded
affirmatively When you hear a knock at the door you will uncover
your eyes added Willarski I wish you courage and success and
pressing Pierres hand he went out

Left alone Pierre went on smiling in the same way Once or twice he
shrugged his shoulders and raised his hand to the kerchief as if
wishing to take it off but let it drop again The five minutes spent
with his eyes bandaged seemed to him an hour His arms felt numb his
legs almost gave way it seemed to him that he was tired out He
experienced a variety of most complex sensations He felt afraid of what
would happen to him and still more afraid of showing his fear He felt
curious to know what was going to happen and what would be revealed to
him but most of all he felt joyful that the moment had come when he
would at last start on that path of regeneration and on the actively
virtuous life of which he had been dreaming since he met Joseph
Alexeevich Loud knocks were heard at the door Pierre took the bandage
off his eyes and glanced around him The room was in black darkness
only a small lamp was burning inside something white Pierre went nearer
and saw that the lamp stood on a black table on which lay an open book
The book was the Gospel and the white thing with the lamp inside was a
human skull with its cavities and teeth After reading the first words
of the Gospel In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with
God Pierre went round the table and saw a large open box filled with
something It was a coffin with bones inside He was not at all
surprised by what he saw Hoping to enter on an entirely new life quite
unlike the old one he expected everything to be unusual even more
unusual than what he was seeing A skull a coffin the Gospelit seemed
to him that he had expected all this and even more Trying to stimulate
his emotions he looked around God death love the brotherhood of
man he kept saying to himself associating these words with vague yet
joyful ideas The door opened and someone came in

By the dim light to which Pierre had already become accustomed he saw
a rather short man Having evidently come from the light into the
darkness the man paused then moved with cautious steps toward the
table and placed on it his small leathergloved hands

This short man had on a white leather apron which covered his chest and
part of his legs he had on a kind of necklace above which rose a high
white ruffle outlining his rather long face which was lit up from
below

For what have you come hither asked the newcomer turning in Pierres
direction at a slight rustle made by the latter Why have you who do
not believe in the truth of the light and who have not seen the light
come here What do you seek from us Wisdom virtue enlightenment

At the moment the door opened and the stranger came in Pierre felt a
sense of awe and veneration such as he had experienced in his boyhood at
confession he felt himself in the presence of one socially a complete
stranger yet nearer to him through the brotherhood of man With bated
breath and beating heart he moved toward the Rhetor by which name the
brother who prepared a seeker for entrance into the Brotherhood was
known Drawing nearer he recognized in the Rhetor a man he knew
Smolyaninov and it mortified him to think that the newcomer was an
acquaintancehe wished him simply a brother and a virtuous instructor
For a long time he could not utter a word so that the Rhetor had to
repeat his question

Yes I I desire regeneration Pierre uttered with difficulty

Very well said Smolyaninov and went on at once Have you any idea
of the means by which our holy Order will help you to reach your aim
said he quietly and quickly

I hope for guidance help in regeneration said Pierre
with a trembling voice and some difficulty in utterance due to his
excitement and to being unaccustomed to speak of abstract matters in
Russian

What is your conception of Freemasonry

I imagine that Freemasonry is the fraternity and equality of men who
have virtuous aims said Pierre feeling ashamed of the inadequacy of
his words for the solemnity of the moment as he spoke I imagine

Good said the Rhetor quickly apparently satisfied with this answer
Have you sought for means of attaining your aim in religion

No I considered it erroneous and did not follow it said Pierre so
softly that the Rhetor did not hear him and asked him what he was
saying I have been an atheist answered Pierre

You are seeking for truth in order to follow its laws in your life
therefore you seek wisdom and virtue Is that not so said the Rhetor
after a moments pause

Yes yes assented Pierre

The Rhetor cleared his throat crossed his gloved hands on his breast
and began to speak

Now I must disclose to you the chief aim of our Order he said and
if this aim coincides with yours you may enter our Brotherhood with
profit The first and chief object of our Order the foundation on which
it rests and which no human power can destroy is the preservation and
handing on to posterity of a certain important mystery which has come
down to us from the remotest ages even from the first mana mystery on
which perhaps the fate of mankind depends But since this mystery is of
such a nature that nobody can know or use it unless he be prepared by
long and diligent selfpurification not everyone can hope to attain it
quickly Hence we have a secondary aim that of preparing our members as
much as possible to reform their hearts to purify and enlighten their
minds by means handed on to us by tradition from those who have striven
to attain this mystery and thereby to render them capable of receiving
it

By purifying and regenerating our members we try thirdly to improve
the whole human race offering it in our members an example of piety and
virtue and thereby try with all our might to combat the evil which
sways the world Think this over and I will come to you again

To combat the evil which sways the world Pierre repeated and a
mental image of his future activity in this direction rose in his mind
He imagined men such as he had himself been a fortnight ago and he
addressed an edifying exhortation to them He imagined to himself
vicious and unfortunate people whom he would assist by word and deed
imagined oppressors whose victims he would rescue Of the three objects
mentioned by the Rhetor this last that of improving mankind
especially appealed to Pierre The important mystery mentioned by the
Rhetor though it aroused his curiosity did not seem to him essential
and the second aim that of purifying and regenerating himself did not
much interest him because at that moment he felt with delight that he
was already perfectly cured of his former faults and was ready for all
that was good

Half an hour later the Rhetor returned to inform the seeker of the
seven virtues corresponding to the seven steps of Solomons temple
which every Freemason should cultivate in himself These virtues were
1 Discretion the keeping of the secrets of the Order 2 Obedience to
those of higher ranks in the Order 3 Morality 4 Love of mankind 5
Courage 6 Generosity 7 The love of death

In the seventh place try by the frequent thought of death the
Rhetor said to bring yourself to regard it not as a dreaded foe but
as a friend that frees the soul grown weary in the labors of virtue from
this distressful life and leads it to its place of recompense and
peace

Yes that must be so thought Pierre when after these words the
Rhetor went away leaving him to solitary meditation It must be so
but I am still so weak that I love my life the meaning of which is only
now gradually opening before me But five of the other virtues which
Pierre recalled counting them on his fingers he felt already in his
soul courage generosity morality love of mankind and especially
obediencewhich did not even seem to him a virtue but a joy He now
felt so glad to be free from his own lawlessness and to submit his will
to those who knew the indubitable truth He forgot what the seventh
virtue was and could not recall it

The third time the Rhetor came back more quickly and asked Pierre
whether he was still firm in his intention and determined to submit to
all that would be required of him

I am ready for everything said Pierre

I must also inform you said the Rhetor that our Order delivers its
teaching not in words only but also by other means which may perhaps
have a stronger effect on the sincere seeker after wisdom and virtue
than mere words This chamber with what you see therein should already
have suggested to your heart if it is sincere more than words could
do You will perhaps also see in your further initiation a like method
of enlightenment Our Order imitates the ancient societies that
explained their teaching by hieroglyphics A hieroglyph said the
Rhetor is an emblem of something not cognizable by the senses but
which possesses qualities resembling those of the symbol

Pierre knew very well what a hieroglyph was but dared not speak He
listened to the Rhetor in silence feeling from all he said that his
ordeal was about to begin

If you are resolved I must begin your initiation said the Rhetor
coming closer to Pierre In token of generosity I ask you to give me
all your valuables

But I have nothing here replied Pierre supposing that he was asked
to give up all he possessed

What you have with you watch money rings

Pierre quickly took out his purse and watch but could not manage for
some time to get the wedding ring off his fat finger When that had been
done the Rhetor said

In token of obedience I ask you to undress

Pierre took off his coat waistcoat and left boot according to the
Rhetors instructions The Mason drew the shirt back from Pierres left
breast and stooping down pulled up the left leg of his trousers to
above the knee Pierre hurriedly began taking off his right boot also
and was going to tuck up the other trouser leg to save this stranger the
trouble but the Mason told him that was not necessary and gave him a
slipper for his left foot With a childlike smile of embarrassment
doubt and selfderision which appeared on his face against his will
Pierre stood with his arms hanging down and legs apart before his
brother Rhetor and awaited his further commands

And now in token of candor I ask you to reveal to me your chief
passion said the latter

My passion I have had so many replied Pierre

That passion which more than all others caused you to waver on the path
of virtue said the Mason

Pierre paused seeking a reply

Wine Gluttony Idleness Laziness Irritability Anger Women He
went over his vices in his mind not knowing to which of them to give
the preeminence

Women he said in a low scarcely audible voice

The Mason did not move and for a long time said nothing after this
answer At last he moved up to Pierre and taking the kerchief that lay
on the table again bound his eyes

For the last time I say to youturn all your attention upon yourself
put a bridle on your senses and seek blessedness not in passion but in
your own heart The source of blessedness is not without us but
within

Pierre had already long been feeling in himself that refreshing source
of blessedness which now flooded his heart with glad emotion





CHAPTER IV

Soon after this there came into the dark chamber to fetch Pierre not
the Rhetor but Pierres sponsor Willarski whom he recognized by his
voice To fresh questions as to the firmness of his resolution Pierre
replied Yes yes I agree and with a beaming childlike smile his
fat chest uncovered stepping unevenly and timidly in one slippered and
one booted foot he advanced while Willarski held a sword to his bare
chest He was conducted from that room along passages that turned
backwards and forwards and was at last brought to the doors of the
Lodge Willarski coughed he was answered by the masonic knock with
mallets the doors opened before them A bass voice Pierre was still
blindfolded questioned him as to who he was when and where he was
born and so on Then he was again led somewhere still blindfolded and
as they went along he was told allegories of the toils of his
pilgrimage of holy friendship of the Eternal Architect of the
universe and of the courage with which he should endure toils and
dangers During these wanderings Pierre noticed that he was spoken of
now as the Seeker now as the Sufferer and now as the Postulant
to the accompaniment of various knockings with mallets and swords As he
was being led up to some object he noticed a hesitation and uncertainty
among his conductors He heard those around him disputing in whispers
and one of them insisting that he should be led along a certain carpet
After that they took his right hand placed it on something and told
him to hold a pair of compasses to his left breast with the other hand
and to repeat after someone who read aloud an oath of fidelity to the
laws of the Order The candles were then extinguished and some spirit
lighted as Pierre knew by the smell and he was told that he would now
see the lesser light The bandage was taken off his eyes and by the
faint light of the burning spirit Pierre as in a dream saw several
men standing before him wearing aprons like the Rhetors and holding
swords in their hands pointed at his breast Among them stood a man
whose white shirt was stained with blood On seeing this Pierre moved
forward with his breast toward the swords meaning them to pierce it
But the swords were drawn back from him and he was at once blindfolded
again

Now thou hast seen the lesser light uttered a voice Then the candles
were relit and he was told that he would see the full light the bandage
was again removed and more than ten voices said together Sic transit
gloria mundi

Pierre gradually began to recover himself and looked about at the room
and at the people in it Round a long table covered with black sat some
twelve men in garments like those he had already seen Some of them
Pierre had met in Petersburg society In the Presidents chair sat a
young man he did not know with a peculiar cross hanging from his neck
On his right sat the Italian abb whom Pierre had met at Anna Pvlovnas
two years before There were also present a very distinguished dignitary
and a Swiss who had formerly been tutor at the Kurgins All maintained
a solemn silence listening to the words of the President who held a
mallet in his hand Let into the wall was a starshaped light At one
side of the table was a small carpet with various figures worked upon
it at the other was something resembling an altar on which lay a
Testament and a skull Round it stood seven large candlesticks like
those used in churches Two of the brothers led Pierre up to the altar
placed his feet at right angles and bade him lie down saying that he
must prostrate himself at the Gates of the Temple

He must first receive the trowel whispered one of the brothers

Oh hush please said another

Pierre perplexed looked round with his shortsighted eyes without
obeying and suddenly doubts arose in his mind Where am I What am I
doing Arent they laughing at me Shant I be ashamed to remember
this But these doubts only lasted a moment Pierre glanced at the
serious faces of those around remembered all he had already gone
through and realized that he could not stop halfway He was aghast at
his hesitation and trying to arouse his former devotional feeling
prostrated himself before the Gates of the Temple And really the
feeling of devotion returned to him even more strongly than before When
he had lain there some time he was told to get up and a white leather
apron such as the others wore was put on him he was given a trowel
and three pairs of gloves and then the Grand Master addressed him He
told him that he should try to do nothing to stain the whiteness of that
apron which symbolized strength and purity then of the unexplained
trowel he told him to toil with it to cleanse his own heart from vice
and indulgently to smooth with it the heart of his neighbor As to the
first pair of gloves a mans he said that Pierre could not know their
meaning but must keep them The second pair of mans gloves he was to
wear at the meetings and finally of the third a pair of womens
gloves he said Dear brother these womans gloves are intended for
you too Give them to the woman whom you shall honor most of all This
gift will be a pledge of your purity of heart to her whom you select to
be your worthy helpmeet in Masonry And after a pause he added But
beware dear brother that these gloves do not deck hands that are
unclean While the Grand Master said these last words it seemed to
Pierre that he grew embarrassed Pierre himself grew still more
confused blushed like a child till tears came to his eyes began
looking about him uneasily and an awkward pause followed

This silence was broken by one of the brethren who led Pierre up to the
rug and began reading to him from a manuscript book an explanation of
all the figures on it the sun the moon a hammer a plumb line a
trowel a rough stone and a squared stone a pillar three windows and
so on Then a place was assigned to Pierre he was shown the signs of
the Lodge told the password and at last was permitted to sit down The
Grand Master began reading the statutes They were very long and
Pierre from joy agitation and embarrassment was not in a state to
understand what was being read He managed to follow only the last words
of the statutes and these remained in his mind

In our temples we recognize no other distinctions read the Grand
Master but those between virtue and vice Beware of making any
distinctions which may infringe equality Fly to a brothers aid whoever
he may be exhort him who goeth astray raise him that falleth never
bear malice or enmity toward thy brother Be kindly and courteous
Kindle in all hearts the flame of virtue Share thy happiness with thy
neighbor and may envy never dim the purity of that bliss Forgive thy
enemy do not avenge thyself except by doing him good Thus fulfilling
the highest law thou shalt regain traces of the ancient dignity which
thou hast lost

He finished and getting up embraced and kissed Pierre who with tears
of joy in his eyes looked round him not knowing how to answer the
congratulations and greetings from acquaintances that met him on all
sides He acknowledged no acquaintances but saw in all these men only
brothers and burned with impatience to set to work with them

The Grand Master rapped with his mallet All the Masons sat down in
their places and one of them read an exhortation on the necessity of
humility

The Grand Master proposed that the last duty should be performed and
the distinguished dignitary who bore the title of Collector of Alms
went round to all the brothers Pierre would have liked to subscribe all
he had but fearing that it might look like pride subscribed the same
amount as the others

The meeting was at an end and on reaching home Pierre felt as if he had
returned from a long journey on which he had spent dozens of years had
become completely changed and had quite left behind his former habits
and way of life





CHAPTER V

The day after he had been received into the Lodge Pierre was sitting at
home reading a book and trying to fathom the significance of the Square
one side of which symbolized God another moral things a third physical
things and the fourth a combination of these Now and then his
attention wandered from the book and the Square and he formed in
imagination a new plan of life On the previous evening at the Lodge he
had heard that a rumor of his duel had reached the Emperor and that it
would be wiser for him to leave Petersburg Pierre proposed going to his
estates in the south and there attending to the welfare of his serfs He
was joyfully planning this new life when Prince Vasli suddenly entered
the room

My dear fellow what have you been up to in Moscow Why have you
quarreled with Hlne mon cher You are under a delusion said Prince
Vasli as he entered I know all about it and I can tell you
positively that Hlne is as innocent before you as Christ was before
the Jews

Pierre was about to reply but Prince Vasli interrupted him

And why didnt you simply come straight to me as to a friend I know
all about it and understand it all he said You behaved as becomes a
man who values his honor perhaps too hastily but we wont go into
that But consider the position in which you are placing her and me in
the eyes of society and even of the court he added lowering his
voice She is living in Moscow and you are here Remember dear boy
and he drew Pierres arm downwards it is simply a misunderstanding I
expect you feel it so yourself Let us write her a letter at once and
shell come here and all will be explained or else my dear boy let me
tell you its quite likely youll have to suffer for it

Prince Vasli gave Pierre a significant look

I know from reliable sources that the Dowager Empress is taking a keen
interest in the whole affair You know she is very gracious to Hlne

Pierre tried several times to speak but on one hand Prince Vasli did
not let him and on the other Pierre himself feared to begin to speak
in the tone of decided refusal and disagreement in which he had firmly
resolved to answer his fatherinlaw Moreover the words of the masonic
statutes be kindly and courteous recurred to him He blinked went
red got up and sat down again struggling with himself to do what was
for him the most difficult thing in lifeto say an unpleasant thing to a
mans face to say what the other whoever he might be did not expect
He was so used to submitting to Prince Vaslis tone of careless self
assurance that he felt he would be unable to withstand it now but he
also felt that on what he said now his future dependedwhether he would
follow the same old road or that new path so attractively shown him by
the Masons on which he firmly believed he would be reborn to a new
life

Now dear boy said Prince Vasli playfully say yes and Ill
write to her myself and we will kill the fatted calf

But before Prince Vasli had finished his playful speech Pierre
without looking at him and with a kind of fury that made him like his
father muttered in a whisper

Prince I did not ask you here Go please go And he jumped up and
opened the door for him

Go he repeated amazed at himself and glad to see the look of
confusion and fear that showed itself on Prince Vaslis face

Whats the matter with you Are you ill

Go the quivering voice repeated And Prince Vasli had to go without
receiving any explanation

A week later Pierre having taken leave of his new friends the Masons
and leaving large sums of money with them for alms went away to his
estates His new brethren gave him letters to the Kiev and Odessa Masons
and promised to write to him and guide him in his new activity





CHAPTER VI

The duel between Pierre and Dlokhov was hushed up and in spite of the
Emperors severity regarding duels at that time neither the principals
nor their seconds suffered for it But the story of the duel confirmed
by Pierres rupture with his wife was the talk of society Pierre who
had been regarded with patronizing condescension when he was an
illegitimate son and petted and extolled when he was the best match in
Russia had sunk greatly in the esteem of society after his
marriagewhen the marriageable daughters and their mothers had nothing
to hope from himespecially as he did not know how and did not wish to
court societys favor Now he alone was blamed for what had happened he
was said to be insanely jealous and subject like his father to fits of
bloodthirsty rage And when after Pierres departure Hlne returned to
Petersburg she was received by all her acquaintances not only
cordially but even with a shade of deference due to her misfortune
When conversation turned on her husband Hlne assumed a dignified
expression which with characteristic tact she had acquired though she
did not understand its significance This expression suggested that she
had resolved to endure her troubles uncomplainingly and that her husband
was a cross laid upon her by God Prince Vasli expressed his opinion
more openly He shrugged his shoulders when Pierre was mentioned and
pointing to his forehead remarked

A bit touchedI always said so

I said from the first declared Anna Pvlovna referring to Pierre I
said at the time and before anyone else she insisted on her priority
that that senseless young man was spoiled by the depraved ideas of
these days I said so even at the time when everybody was in raptures
about him when he had just returned from abroad and when if you
remember he posed as a sort of Marat at one of my soirees And how has
it ended I was against this marriage even then and foretold all that
has happened

Anna Pvlovna continued to give on free evenings the same kind of
soirees as beforesuch as she alone had the gift of arrangingat which
was to be found the cream of really good society the bloom of the
intellectual essence of Petersburg as she herself put it Besides this
refined selection of society Anna Pvlovnas receptions were also
distinguished by the fact that she always presented some new and
interesting person to the visitors and that nowhere else was the state
of the political thermometer of legitimate Petersburg court society so
dearly and distinctly indicated

Toward the end of 1806 when all the sad details of Napoleons
destruction of the Prussian army at Jena and Auerstadt and the surrender
of most of the Prussian fortresses had been received when our troops
had already entered Prussia and our second war with Napoleon was
beginning Anna Pvlovna gave one of her soirees The cream of really
good society consisted of the fascinating Hlne forsaken by her
husband Mortemart the delightful Prince Hippolyte who had just
returned from Vienna two diplomatists the old aunt a young man
referred to in that drawing room as a man of great merit un homme de
beaucoup de merite a newly appointed maid of honor and her mother and
several other less noteworthy persons

The novelty Anna Pvlovna was setting before her guests that evening was
Bors Drubetsky who had just arrived as a special messenger from the
Prussian army and was aidedecamp to a very important personage

The temperature shown by the political thermometer to the company that
evening was this

Whatever the European sovereigns and commanders may do to countenance
Bonaparte and to cause me and us in general annoyance and
mortification our opinion of Bonaparte cannot alter We shall not cease
to express our sincere views on that subject and can only say to the
King of Prussia and others So much the worse for you Tu las voulu
George Dandin thats all we have to say about it

When Bors who was to be served up to the guests entered the drawing
room almost all the company had assembled and the conversation guided
by Anna Pvlovna was about our diplomatic relations with Austria and
the hope of an alliance with her

Bors grown more manly and looking fresh rosy and selfpossessed
entered the drawing room elegantly dressed in the uniform of an aidede
camp and was duly conducted to pay his respects to the aunt and then
brought back to the general circle

Anna Pvlovna gave him her shriveled hand to kiss and introduced him to
several persons whom he did not know giving him a whispered description
of each

Prince Hippolyte Kurgin M Krug the charge daffaires from
Copenhagena profound intellect and simply Mr Shitova man of great
meritthis of the man usually so described

Thanks to Anna Mikhylovnas efforts his own tastes and the
peculiarities of his reserved nature Bors had managed during his
service to place himself very advantageously He was aidedecamp to a
very important personage had been sent on a very important mission to
Prussia and had just returned from there as a special messenger He had
become thoroughly conversant with that unwritten code with which he had
been so pleased at Olmutz and according to which an ensign might rank
incomparably higher than a general and according to which what was
needed for success in the service was not effort or work or courage or
perseverance but only the knowledge of how to get on with those who can
grant rewards and he was himself often surprised at the rapidity of his
success and at the inability of others to understand these things In
consequence of this discovery his whole manner of life all his
relations with old friends all his plans for his future were
completely altered He was not rich but would spend his last groat to
be better dressed than others and would rather deprive himself of many
pleasures than allow himself to be seen in a shabby equipage or appear
in the streets of Petersburg in an old uniform He made friends with and
sought the acquaintance of only those above him in position and who
could therefore be of use to him He liked Petersburg and despised
Moscow The remembrance of the Rostvs house and of his childish love
for Natsha was unpleasant to him and he had not once been to see the
Rostvs since the day of his departure for the army To be in Anna
Pvlovnas drawing room he considered an important step up in the
service and he at once understood his role letting his hostess make
use of whatever interest he had to offer He himself carefully scanned
each face appraising the possibilities of establishing intimacy with
each of those present and the advantages that might accrue He took the
seat indicated to him beside the fair Hlne and listened to the general
conversation

Vienna considers the bases of the proposed treaty so unattainable that
not even a continuity of most brilliant successes would secure them and
she doubts the means we have of gaining them That is the actual phrase
used by the Vienna cabinet said the Danish charge daffaires

The doubt is flattering said the man of profound intellect with a
subtle smile

We must distinguish between the Vienna cabinet and the Emperor of
Austria said Mortemart The Emperor of Austria can never have thought
of such a thing it is only the cabinet that says it

Ah my dear vicomte put in Anna Pvlovna LUrope for some reason
she called it Urope as if that were a specially refined French
pronunciation which she could allow herself when conversing with a
Frenchman LUrope ne sera jamais notre alliee sincere

 Europe will never be our sincere ally

After that Anna Pvlovna led up to the courage and firmness of the King
of Prussia in order to draw Bors into the conversation

Bors listened attentively to each of the speakers awaiting his turn
but managed meanwhile to look round repeatedly at his neighbor the
beautiful Hlne whose eyes several times met those of the handsome
young aidedecamp with a smile

Speaking of the position of Prussia Anna Pvlovna very naturally asked
Bors to tell them about his journey to Glogau and in what state he
found the Prussian army Bors speaking with deliberation told them in
pure correct French many interesting details about the armies and the
court carefully abstaining from expressing an opinion of his own about
the facts he was recounting For some time he engrossed the general
attention and Anna Pvlovna felt that the novelty she had served up was
received with pleasure by all her visitors The greatest attention of
all to Bors narrative was shown by Hlne She asked him several
questions about his journey and seemed greatly interested in the state
of the Prussian army As soon as he had finished she turned to him with
her usual smile

You absolutely must come and see me she said in a tone that implied
that for certain considerations he could not know of this was
absolutely necessary

On Tuesday between eight and nine It will give me great pleasure

Bors promised to fulfill her wish and was about to begin a conversation
with her when Anna Pvlovna called him away on the pretext that her
aunt wished to hear him

You know her husband of course said Anna Pvlovna closing her eyes
and indicating Hlne with a sorrowful gesture Ah she is such an
unfortunate and charming woman Dont mention him before herplease
dont It is too painful for her





CHAPTER VII

When Bors and Anna Pvlovna returned to the others Prince Hippolyte had
the ear of the company

Bending forward in his armchair he said Le Roi de Prusse and having
said this laughed Everyone turned toward him

Le Roi de Prusse Hippolyte said interrogatively again laughing and
then calmly and seriously sat back in his chair Anna Pvlovna waited
for him to go on but as he seemed quite decided to say no more she
began to tell of how at Potsdam the impious Bonaparte had stolen the
sword of Frederick the Great

It is the sword of Frederick the Great which I she began but
Hippolyte interrupted her with the words Le Roi de Prusse and
again as soon as all turned toward him excused himself and said no
more

Anna Pvlovna frowned Mortemart Hippolytes friend addressed him
firmly

Come now what about your Roi de Prusse

Hippolyte laughed as if ashamed of laughing

Oh its nothing I only wished to say he wanted to repeat a joke
he had heard in Vienna and which he had been trying all that evening to
get in I only wished to say that we are wrong to fight pour le Roi de
Prusse

Bors smiled circumspectly so that it might be taken as ironical or
appreciative according to the way the joke was received Everybody
laughed

Your joke is too bad its witty but unjust said Anna Pvlovna
shaking her little shriveled finger at him

We are not fighting pour le Roi de Prusse but for right principles
Oh that wicked Prince Hippolyte she said

The conversation did not flag all evening and turned chiefly on the
political news It became particularly animated toward the end of the
evening when the rewards bestowed by the Emperor were mentioned

You know N N received a snuffbox with the portrait last year said
the man of profound intellect Why shouldnt S S get the same
distinction

Pardon me A snuffbox with the Emperors portrait is a reward but not a
distinction said the diplomatista gift rather

There are precedents I may mention Schwarzenberg

Its impossible replied another

Will you bet The ribbon of the order is a different matter

When everybody rose to go Hlne who had spoken very little all the
evening again turned to Bors asking him in a tone of caressing
significant command to come to her on Tuesday

It is of great importance to me she said turning with a smile toward
Anna Pvlovna and Anna Pvlovna with the same sad smile with which she
spoke of her exalted patroness supported Hlnes wish

It seemed as if from some words Bors had spoken that evening about the
Prussian army Hlne had suddenly found it necessary to see him She
seemed to promise to explain that necessity to him when he came on
Tuesday

But on Tuesday evening having come to Hlnes splendid salon Bors
received no clear explanation of why it had been necessary for him to
come There were other guests and the countess talked little to him and
only as he kissed her hand on taking leave said unexpectedly and in a
whisper with a strangely unsmiling face Come to dinner tomorrow in
the evening You must come Come

During that stay in Petersburg Bors became an intimate in the
countess house





CHAPTER VIII

The war was flaming up and nearing the Russian frontier Everywhere one
heard curses on Bonaparte the enemy of mankind Militiamen and
recruits were being enrolled in the villages and from the seat of war
came contradictory news false as usual and therefore variously
interpreted The life of old Prince Bolknski Prince Andrew and
Princess Mary had greatly changed since 1805

In 1806 the old prince was made one of the eight commanders in chief
then appointed to supervise the enrollment decreed throughout Russia
Despite the weakness of age which had become particularly noticeable
since the time when he thought his son had been killed he did not think
it right to refuse a duty to which he had been appointed by the Emperor
himself and this fresh opportunity for action gave him new energy and
strength He was continually traveling through the three provinces
entrusted to him was pedantic in the fulfillment of his duties severe
to cruel with his subordinates and went into everything down to the
minutest details himself Princess Mary had ceased taking lessons in
mathematics from her father and when the old prince was at home went to
his study with the wet nurse and little Prince Nicholas as his
grandfather called him The baby Prince Nicholas lived with his wet
nurse and nurse Savishna in the late princess rooms and Princess Mary
spent most of the day in the nursery taking a mothers place to her
little nephew as best she could Mademoiselle Bourienne too seemed
passionately fond of the boy and Princess Mary often deprived herself
to give her friend the pleasure of dandling the little angelas she
called her nephewand playing with him

Near the altar of the church at Bald Hills there was a chapel over the
tomb of the little princess and in this chapel was a marble monument
brought from Italy representing an angel with outspread wings ready to
fly upwards The angels upper lip was slightly raised as though about
to smile and once on coming out of the chapel Prince Andrew and
Princess Mary admitted to one another that the angels face reminded
them strangely of the little princess But what was still stranger
though of this Prince Andrew said nothing to his sister was that in the
expression the sculptor had happened to give the angels face Prince
Andrew read the same mild reproach he had read on the face of his dead
wife Ah why have you done this to me

Soon after Prince Andrews return the old prince made over to him a
large estate Bogucharovo about twentyfive miles from Bald Hills
Partly because of the depressing memories associated with Bald Hills
partly because Prince Andrew did not always feel equal to bearing with
his fathers peculiarities and partly because he needed solitude
Prince Andrew made use of Bogucharovo began building and spent most of
his time there

After the Austerlitz campaign Prince Andrew had firmly resolved not to
continue his military service and when the war recommenced and
everybody had to serve he took a post under his father in the
recruitment so as to avoid active service The old prince and his son
seemed to have changed roles since the campaign of 1805 The old man
roused by activity expected the best results from the new campaign
while Prince Andrew on the contrary taking no part in the war and
secretly regretting this saw only the dark side

On February 26 1807 the old prince set off on one of his circuits
Prince Andrew remained at Bald Hills as usual during his fathers
absence Little Nicholas had been unwell for four days The coachman who
had driven the old prince to town returned bringing papers and letters
for Prince Andrew

Not finding the young prince in his study the valet went with the
letters to Princess Marys apartments but did not find him there He
was told that the prince had gone to the nursery

If you please your excellency Petrusha has brought some papers said
one of the nursemaids to Prince Andrew who was sitting on a childs
little chair while frowning and with trembling hands he poured drops
from a medicine bottle into a wineglass half full of water

What is it he said crossly and his hand shaking unintentionally he
poured too many drops into the glass He threw the mixture onto the
floor and asked for some more water The maid brought it

There were in the room a childs cot two boxes two armchairs a table
a childs table and the little chair on which Prince Andrew was
sitting The curtains were drawn and a single candle was burning on the
table screened by a bound music book so that the light did not fall on
the cot

My dear said Princess Mary addressing her brother from beside the
cot where she was standing better wait a bit later

Oh leave off you always talk nonsense and keep putting things offand
this is what comes of it said Prince Andrew in an exasperated whisper
evidently meaning to wound his sister

My dear really its better not to wake him hes asleep said
the princess in a tone of entreaty

Prince Andrew got up and went on tiptoe up to the little bed wineglass
in hand

Perhaps wed really better not wake him he said hesitating

As you please really I think so but as you please said
Princess Mary evidently intimidated and confused that her opinion had
prevailed She drew her brothers attention to the maid who was calling
him in a whisper

It was the second night that neither of them had slept watching the boy
who was in a high fever These last days mistrusting their household
doctor and expecting another for whom they had sent to town they had
been trying first one remedy and then another Worn out by sleeplessness
and anxiety they threw their burden of sorrow on one another and
reproached and disputed with each other

Petrusha has come with papers from your father whispered the maid

Prince Andrew went out

Devil take them he muttered and after listening to the verbal
instructions his father had sent and taking the correspondence and his
fathers letter he returned to the nursery

Well he asked

Still the same Wait for heavens sake Karl Ivanich always says that
sleep is more important than anything whispered Princess Mary with a
sigh

Prince Andrew went up to the child and felt him He was burning hot

Confound you and your Karl Ivanich He took the glass with the drops
and again went up to the cot

Andrew dont said Princess Mary

But he scowled at her angrily though also with suffering in his eyes
and stooped glass in hand over the infant

But I wish it he said I beg yougive it him

Princess Mary shrugged her shoulders but took the glass submissively and
calling the nurse began giving the medicine The child screamed
hoarsely Prince Andrew winced and clutching his head went out and sat
down on a sofa in the next room

He still had all the letters in his hand Opening them mechanically he
began reading The old prince now and then using abbreviations wrote
in his large elongated hand on blue paper as follows

Have just this moment received by special messenger very joyful newsif
its not false Bennigsen seems to have obtained a complete victory over
Buonaparte at Eylau In Petersburg everyone is rejoicing and the
rewards sent to the army are innumerable Though he is a GermanI
congratulate him I cant make out what the commander at Korchevoa
certain Khandrikovis up to till now the additional men and provisions
have not arrived Gallop off to him at once and say Ill have his head
off if everything is not here in a week Have received another letter
about the PreussischEylau battle from Petenkahe took part in itand
its all true When mischiefmakers dont meddle even a German beats
Buonaparte He is said to be fleeing in great disorder Mind you gallop
off to Korchevo without delay and carry out instructions

Prince Andrew sighed and broke the seal of another envelope It was a
closely written letter of two sheets from Bilibin He folded it up
without reading it and reread his fathers letter ending with the
words Gallop off to Korchevo and carry out instructions

No pardon me I wont go now till the child is better thought he
going to the door and looking into the nursery

Princess Mary was still standing by the cot gently rocking the baby

Ah yes and what else did he say thats unpleasant thought Prince
Andrew recalling his fathers letter Yes we have gained a victory
over Bonaparte just when Im not serving Yes yes hes always poking
fun at me Ah well Let him And he began reading Bilibins letter
which was written in French He read without understanding half of it
read only to forget if but for a moment what he had too long been
thinking of so painfully to the exclusion of all else





CHAPTER IX

Bilibin was now at army headquarters in a diplomatic capacity and
though he wrote in French and used French jests and French idioms he
described the whole campaign with a fearless selfcensure and self
derision genuinely Russian Bilibin wrote that the obligation of
diplomatic discretion tormented him and he was happy to have in Prince
Andrew a reliable correspondent to whom he could pour out the bile he
had accumulated at the sight of all that was being done in the army The
letter was old having been written before the battle at Preussisch
Eylau

Since the day of our brilliant success at Austerlitz wrote Bilibin
as you know my dear prince I never leave headquarters I have
certainly acquired a taste for war and it is just as well for me what
I have seen during these last three months is incredible

I begin ab ovo The enemy of the human race as you know attacks the
Prussians The Prussians are our faithful allies who have only betrayed
us three times in three years We take up their cause but it turns out
that the enemy of the human race pays no heed to our fine speeches and
in his rude and savage way throws himself on the Prussians without
giving them time to finish the parade they had begun and in two twists
of the hand he breaks them to smithereens and installs himself in the
palace at Potsdam

I most ardently desire writes the King of Prussia to Bonaparte
that Your Majesty should be received and treated in my palace in a
manner agreeable to yourself and in so far as circumstances allowed I
have hastened to take all steps to that end May I have succeeded The
Prussian generals pride themselves on being polite to the French and lay
down their arms at the first demand

The head of the garrison at Glogau with ten thousand men asks the
King of Prussia what he is to do if he is summoned to surrender All
this is absolutely true

In short hoping to settle matters by taking up a warlike attitude it
turns out that we have landed ourselves in war and what is more in war
on our own frontiers with and for the King of Prussia We have
everything in perfect order only one little thing is lacking namely a
commander in chief As it was considered that the Austerlitz success
might have been more decisive had the commanderinchief not been so
young all our octogenarians were reviewed and of Prozorovski and
Kamenski the latter was preferred The general comes to us Suvrov
like in a kibitka and is received with acclamations of joy and
triumph

On the 4th the first courier arrives from Petersburg The mails are
taken to the field marshals room for he likes to do everything
himself I am called in to help sort the letters and take those meant
for us The field marshal looks on and waits for letters addressed to
him We search but none are to be found The field marshal grows
impatient and sets to work himself and finds letters from the Emperor to
Count T Prince V and others Then he bursts into one of his wild
furies and rages at everyone and everything seizes the letters opens
them and reads those from the Emperor addressed to others Ah So
thats the way they treat me No confidence in me Ah ordered to keep
an eye on me Very well then Get along with you So he writes the
famous order of the day to General Bennigsen

I am wounded and cannot ride and consequently cannot command the army
You have brought your army corps to Pultusk routed here it is exposed
and without fuel or forage so something must be done and as you
yourself reported to Count Buxhowden yesterday you must think of
retreating to our frontierwhich do today

From all my riding he writes to the Emperor I have got a saddle
sore which coming after all my previous journeys quite prevents my
riding and commanding so vast an army so I have passed on the command
to the general next in seniority Count Buxhowden having sent him my
whole staff and all that belongs to it advising him if there is a lack
of bread to move farther into the interior of Prussia for only one
days ration of bread remains and in some regiments none at all as
reported by the division commanders Ostermann and Sedmoretzki and all
that the peasants had has been eaten up I myself will remain in
hospital at Ostrolenka till I recover In regard to which I humbly
submit my report with the information that if the army remains in its
present bivouac another fortnight there will not be a healthy man left
in it by spring

Grant leave to retire to his country seat to an old man who is already
in any case dishonored by being unable to fulfill the great and glorious
task for which he was chosen I shall await your most gracious
permission here in hospital that I may not have to play the part of a
secretary rather than commander in the army My removal from the army
does not produce the slightest stira blind man has left it There are
thousands such as I in Russia

The field marshal is angry with the Emperor and he punishes us all
isnt it logical

This is the first act Those that follow are naturally increasingly
interesting and entertaining After the field marshals departure it
appears that we are within sight of the enemy and must give battle
Buxhowden is commanderinchief by seniority but General Bennigsen does
not quite see it more particularly as it is he and his corps who are
within sight of the enemy and he wishes to profit by the opportunity to
fight a battle on his own hand as the Germans say He does so This is
the battle of Pultusk which is considered a great victory but in my
opinion was nothing of the kind We civilians as you know have a very
bad way of deciding whether a battle was won or lost Those who retreat
after a battle have lost it is what we say and according to that it is
we who lost the battle of Pultusk In short we retreat after the battle
but send a courier to Petersburg with news of a victory and General
Bennigsen hoping to receive from Petersburg the post of commander in
chief as a reward for his victory does not give up the command of the
army to General Buxhowden During this interregnum we begin a very
original and interesting series of maneuvers Our aim is no longer as
it should be to avoid or attack the enemy but solely to avoid General
Buxhowden who by right of seniority should be our chief So
energetically do we pursue this aim that after crossing an unfordable
river we burn the bridges to separate ourselves from our enemy who at
the moment is not Bonaparte but Buxhowden General Buxhowden was all but
attacked and captured by a superior enemy force as a result of one of
these maneuvers that enabled us to escape him Buxhowden pursues uswe
scuttle He hardly crosses the river to our side before we recross to
the other At last our enemy Buxhowden catches us and attacks Both
generals are angry and the result is a challenge on Buxhowdens part
and an epileptic fit on Bennigsens But at the critical moment the
courier who carried the news of our victory at Pultusk to Petersburg
returns bringing our appointment as commanderinchief and our first
foe Buxhowden is vanquished we can now turn our thoughts to the
second Bonaparte But as it turns out just at that moment a third
enemy rises before usnamely the Orthodox Russian soldiers loudly
demanding bread meat biscuits fodder and whatnot The stores are
empty the roads impassable The Orthodox begin looting and in a way of
which our last campaign can give you no idea Half the regiments form
bands and scour the countryside and put everything to fire and sword
The inhabitants are totally ruined the hospitals overflow with sick
and famine is everywhere Twice the marauders even attack our
headquarters and the commanderinchief has to ask for a battalion to
disperse them During one of these attacks they carried off my empty
portmanteau and my dressing gown The Emperor proposes to give all
commanders of divisions the right to shoot marauders but I much fear
this will oblige one half the army to shoot the other

At first Prince Andrew read with his eyes only but after a while in
spite of himself although he knew how far it was safe to trust
Bilibin what he had read began to interest him more and more When he
had read thus far he crumpled the letter up and threw it away It was
not what he had read that vexed him but the fact that the life out
there in which he had now no part could perturb him He shut his eyes
rubbed his forehead as if to rid himself of all interest in what he had
read and listened to what was passing in the nursery Suddenly he
thought he heard a strange noise through the door He was seized with
alarm lest something should have happened to the child while he was
reading the letter He went on tiptoe to the nursery door and opened it

Just as he went in he saw that the nurse was hiding something from him
with a scared look and that Princess Mary was no longer by the cot

My dear he heard what seemed to him her despairing whisper behind
him

As often happens after long sleeplessness and long anxiety he was
seized by an unreasoning panicit occurred to him that the child was
dead All that he saw and heard seemed to confirm this terror

All is over he thought and a cold sweat broke out on his forehead
He went to the cot in confusion sure that he would find it empty and
that the nurse had been hiding the dead baby He drew the curtain aside
and for some time his frightened restless eyes could not find the baby
At last he saw him the rosy boy had tossed about till he lay across the
bed with his head lower than the pillow and was smacking his lips in
his sleep and breathing evenly

Prince Andrew was as glad to find the boy like that as if he had
already lost him He bent over him and as his sister had taught him
tried with his lips whether the child was still feverish The soft
forehead was moist Prince Andrew touched the head with his hand even
the hair was wet so profusely had the child perspired He was not dead
but evidently the crisis was over and he was convalescent Prince Andrew
longed to snatch up to squeeze to hold to his heart this helpless
little creature but dared not do so He stood over him gazing at his
head and at the little arms and legs which showed under the blanket He
heard a rustle behind him and a shadow appeared under the curtain of the
cot He did not look round but still gazing at the infants face
listened to his regular breathing The dark shadow was Princess Mary
who had come up to the cot with noiseless steps lifted the curtain and
dropped it again behind her Prince Andrew recognized her without
looking and held out his hand to her She pressed it

He has perspired said Prince Andrew

I was coming to tell you so

The child moved slightly in his sleep smiled and rubbed his forehead
against the pillow

Prince Andrew looked at his sister In the dim shadow of the curtain her
luminous eyes shone more brightly than usual from the tears of joy that
were in them She leaned over to her brother and kissed him slightly
catching the curtain of the cot Each made the other a warning gesture
and stood still in the dim light beneath the curtain as if not wishing
to leave that seclusion where they three were shut off from all the
world Prince Andrew was the first to move away ruffling his hair
against the muslin of the curtain

Yes this is the one thing left me now he said with a sigh





CHAPTER X

Soon after his admission to the masonic Brotherhood Pierre went to the
Kiev province where he had the greatest number of serfs taking with
him full directions which he had written down for his own guidance as to
what he should do on his estates

When he reached Kiev he sent for all his stewards to the head office and
explained to them his intentions and wishes He told them that steps
would be taken immediately to free his serfsand that till then they
were not to be overburdened with labor women while nursing their babies
were not to be sent to work assistance was to be given to the serfs
punishments were to be admonitory and not corporal and hospitals
asylums and schools were to be established on all the estates Some of
the stewards there were semiliterate foremen among them listened with
alarm supposing these words to mean that the young count was displeased
with their management and embezzlement of money some after their first
fright were amused by Pierres lisp and the new words they had not heard
before others simply enjoyed hearing how the master talked while the
cleverest among them including the chief steward understood from this
speech how they could best handle the master for their own ends

The chief steward expressed great sympathy with Pierres intentions but
remarked that besides these changes it would be necessary to go into the
general state of affairs which was far from satisfactory

Despite Count Bezkhovs enormous wealth since he had come into an
income which was said to amount to five hundred thousand rubles a year
Pierre felt himself far poorer than when his father had made him an
allowance of ten thousand rubles He had a dim perception of the
following budget

About 80000 went in payments on all the estates to the Land Bank about
30000 went for the upkeep of the estate near Moscow the town house
and the allowance to the three princesses about 15000 was given in
pensions and the same amount for asylums 150000 alimony was sent to
the countess about 70000 went for interest on debts The building of a
new church previously begun had cost about 10000 in each of the last
two years and he did not know how the rest about 100000 rubles was
spent and almost every year he was obliged to borrow Besides this the
chief steward wrote every year telling him of fires and bad harvests or
of the necessity of rebuilding factories and workshops So the first
task Pierre had to face was one for which he had very little aptitude or
inclinationpractical business

He discussed estate affairs every day with his chief steward But he
felt that this did not forward matters at all He felt that these
consultations were detached from real affairs and did not link up with
them or make them move On the one hand the chief steward put the state
of things to him in the very worst light pointing out the necessity of
paying off the debts and undertaking new activities with serf labor to
which Pierre did not agree On the other hand Pierre demanded that
steps should be taken to liberate the serfs which the steward met by
showing the necessity of first paying off the loans from the Land Bank
and the consequent impossibility of a speedy emancipation

The steward did not say it was quite impossible but suggested selling
the forests in the province of Kostroma the land lower down the river
and the Crimean estate in order to make it possible all of which
operations according to him were connected with such complicated
measuresthe removal of injunctions petitions permits and so onthat
Pierre became quite bewildered and only replied

Yes yes do so

Pierre had none of the practical persistence that would have enabled him
to attend to the business himself and so he disliked it and only tried
to pretend to the steward that he was attending to it The steward for
his part tried to pretend to the count that he considered these
consultations very valuable for the proprietor and troublesome to
himself

In Kiev Pierre found some people he knew and strangers hastened to make
his acquaintance and joyfully welcomed the rich newcomer the largest
landowner of the province Temptations to Pierres greatest weaknessthe
one to which he had confessed when admitted to the Lodgewere so strong
that he could not resist them Again whole days weeks and months of
his life passed in as great a rush and were as much occupied with
evening parties dinners lunches and balls giving him no time for
reflection as in Petersburg Instead of the new life he had hoped to
lead he still lived the old life only in new surroundings

Of the three precepts of Freemasonry Pierre realized that he did not
fulfill the one which enjoined every Mason to set an example of moral
life and that of the seven virtues he lacked twomorality and the love
of death He consoled himself with the thought that he fulfilled another
of the preceptsthat of reforming the human raceand had other
virtueslove of his neighbor and especially generosity

In the spring of 1807 he decided to return to Petersburg On the way he
intended to visit all his estates and see for himself how far his orders
had been carried out and in what state were the serfs whom God had
entrusted to his care and whom he intended to benefit

The chief steward who considered the young counts attempts almost
insaneunprofitable to himself to the count and to the serfsmade some
concessions Continuing to represent the liberation of the serfs as
impracticable he arranged for the erection of large buildingsschools
hospitals and asylumson all the estates before the master arrived
Everywhere preparations were made not for ceremonious welcomes which he
knew Pierre would not like but for just such gratefully religious
ones with offerings of icons and the bread and salt of hospitality as
according to his understanding of his master would touch and delude
him

The southern spring the comfortable rapid traveling in a Vienna
carriage and the solitude of the road all had a gladdening effect on
Pierre The estates he had not before visited were each more picturesque
than the other the serfs everywhere seemed thriving and touchingly
grateful for the benefits conferred on them Everywhere were receptions
which though they embarrassed Pierre awakened a joyful feeling in the
depth of his heart In one place the peasants presented him with bread
and salt and an icon of Saint Peter and Saint Paul asking permission
as a mark of their gratitude for the benefits he had conferred on them
to build a new chantry to the church at their own expense in honor of
Peter and Paul his patron saints In another place the women with
infants in arms met him to thank him for releasing them from hard work
On a third estate the priest bearing a cross came to meet him
surrounded by children whom by the counts generosity he was
instructing in reading writing and religion On all his estates Pierre
saw with his own eyes brick buildings erected or in course of erection
all on one plan for hospitals schools and almshouses which were soon
to be opened Everywhere he saw the stewards accounts according to
which the serfs manorial labor had been diminished and heard the
touching thanks of deputations of serfs in their fullskirted blue
coats

What Pierre did not know was that the place where they presented him
with bread and salt and wished to build a chantry in honor of Peter and
Paul was a market village where a fair was held on St Peters day and
that the richest peasants who formed the deputation had begun the
chantry long before but that nine tenths of the peasants in that
villages were in a state of the greatest poverty He did not know that
since the nursing mothers were no longer sent to work on his land they
did still harder work on their own land He did not know that the priest
who met him with the cross oppressed the peasants by his exactions and
that the pupils parents wept at having to let him take their children
and secured their release by heavy payments He did not know that the
brick buildings built to plan were being built by serfs whose manorial
labor was thus increased though lessened on paper He did not know that
where the steward had shown him in the accounts that the serfs payments
had been diminished by a third their obligatory manorial work had been
increased by a half And so Pierre was delighted with his visit to his
estates and quite recovered the philanthropic mood in which he had left
Petersburg and wrote enthusiastic letters to his brotherinstructor
as he called the Grand Master

How easy it is how little effort it needs to do so much good
thought Pierre and how little attention we pay to it

He was pleased at the gratitude he received but felt abashed at
receiving it This gratitude reminded him of how much more he might do
for these simple kindly people

The chief steward a very stupid but cunning man who saw perfectly
through the nave and intelligent count and played with him as with a
toy seeing the effect these prearranged receptions had on Pierre
pressed him still harder with proofs of the impossibility and above all
the uselessness of freeing the serfs who were quite happy as it was

Pierre in his secret soul agreed with the steward that it would be
difficult to imagine happier people and that God only knew what would
happen to them when they were free but he insisted though reluctantly
on what he thought right The steward promised to do all in his power to
carry out the counts wishes seeing clearly that not only would the
count never be able to find out whether all measures had been taken for
the sale of the land and forests and to release them from the Land Bank
but would probably never even inquire and would never know that the
newly erected buildings were standing empty and that the serfs continued
to give in money and work all that other peoples serfs gavethat is to
say all that could be got out of them





CHAPTER XI

Returning from his journey through South Russia in the happiest state of
mind Pierre carried out an intention he had long had of visiting his
friend Bolknski whom he had not seen for two years

Bogucharovo lay in a flat uninteresting part of the country among fields
and forests of fir and birch which were partly cut down The house lay
behind a newly dug pond filled with water to the brink and with banks
still bare of grass It was at the end of a village that stretched along
the highroad in the midst of a young copse in which were a few fir
trees

The homestead consisted of a threshing floor outhouses stables a
bathhouse a lodge and a large brick house with semicircular facade
still in course of construction Round the house was a garden newly laid
out The fences and gates were new and solid two fire pumps and a water
cart painted green stood in a shed the paths were straight the
bridges were strong and had handrails Everything bore an impress of
tidiness and good management Some domestic serfs Pierre met in reply
to inquiries as to where the prince lived pointed out a small newly
built lodge close to the pond Anton a man who had looked after Prince
Andrew in his boyhood helped Pierre out of his carriage said that the
prince was at home and showed him into a clean little anteroom

Pierre was struck by the modesty of the small though clean house after
the brilliant surroundings in which he had last met his friend in
Petersburg

He quickly entered the small reception room with its stillunplastered
wooden walls redolent of pine and would have gone farther but Anton
ran ahead on tiptoe and knocked at a door

Well what is it came a sharp unpleasant voice

A visitor answered Anton

Ask him to wait and the sound was heard of a chair being pushed back

Pierre went with rapid steps to the door and suddenly came face to face
with Prince Andrew who came out frowning and looking old Pierre
embraced him and lifting his spectacles kissed his friend on the cheek
and looked at him closely

Well I did not expect you I am very glad said Prince Andrew

Pierre said nothing he looked fixedly at his friend with surprise He
was struck by the change in him His words were kindly and there was a
smile on his lips and face but his eyes were dull and lifeless and in
spite of his evident wish to do so he could not give them a joyous and
glad sparkle Prince Andrew had grown thinner paler and more manly
looking but what amazed and estranged Pierre till he got used to it
were his inertia and a wrinkle on his brow indicating prolonged
concentration on some one thought

As is usually the case with people meeting after a prolonged separation
it was long before their conversation could settle on anything They put
questions and gave brief replies about things they knew ought to be
talked over at length At last the conversation gradually settled on
some of the topics at first lightly touched on their past life plans
for the future Pierres journeys and occupations the war and so on
The preoccupation and despondency which Pierre had noticed in his
friends look was now still more clearly expressed in the smile with
which he listened to Pierre especially when he spoke with joyful
animation of the past or the future It was as if Prince Andrew would
have liked to sympathize with what Pierre was saying but could not The
latter began to feel that it was in bad taste to speak of his
enthusiasms dreams and hopes of happiness or goodness in Prince
Andrews presence He was ashamed to express his new masonic views
which had been particularly revived and strengthened by his late tour
He checked himself fearing to seem nave yet he felt an irresistible
desire to show his friend as soon as possible that he was now a quite
different and better Pierre than he had been in Petersburg

I cant tell you how much I have lived through since then I hardly
know myself again

Yes we have altered much very much since then said Prince Andrew

Well and you What are your plans

Plans repeated Prince Andrew ironically My plans he said as if
astonished at the word Well you see Im building I mean to settle
here altogether next year

Pierre looked silently and searchingly into Prince Andrews face which
had grown much older

No I meant to ask Pierre began but Prince Andrew interrupted him

But why talk of me Talk to me yes tell me about your travels and
all you have been doing on your estates

Pierre began describing what he had done on his estates trying as far
as possible to conceal his own part in the improvements that had been
made Prince Andrew several times prompted Pierres story of what he had
been doing as though it were all an oldtime story and he listened not
only without interest but even as if ashamed of what Pierre was telling
him

Pierre felt uncomfortable and even depressed in his friends company and
at last became silent

Ill tell you what my dear fellow said Prince Andrew who evidently
also felt depressed and constrained with his visitor I am only
bivouacking here and have just come to look round I am going back to my
sister today I will introduce you to her But of course you know her
already he said evidently trying to entertain a visitor with whom he
now found nothing in common We will go after dinner And would you now
like to look round my place

They went out and walked about till dinnertime talking of the political
news and common acquaintances like people who do not know each other
intimately Prince Andrew spoke with some animation and interest only of
the new homestead he was constructing and its buildings but even here
while on the scaffolding in the midst of a talk explaining the future
arrangements of the house he interrupted himself

However this is not at all interesting Let us have dinner and then
well set off

At dinner conversation turned on Pierres marriage

I was very much surprised when I heard of it said Prince Andrew

Pierre blushed as he always did when it was mentioned and said
hurriedly I will tell you some time how it all happened But you know
it is all over and forever

Forever said Prince Andrew Nothings forever

But you know how it all ended dont you You heard of the duel

And so you had to go through that too

One thing I thank God for is that I did not kill that man said
Pierre

Why so asked Prince Andrew To kill a vicious dog is a very good
thing really

No to kill a man is badwrong

Why is it wrong urged Prince Andrew It is not given to man to know
what is right and what is wrong Men always did and always will err and
in nothing more than in what they consider right and wrong

What does harm to another is wrong said Pierre feeling with pleasure
that for the first time since his arrival Prince Andrew was roused had
begun to talk and wanted to express what had brought him to his present
state

And who has told you what is bad for another man he asked

Bad Bad exclaimed Pierre We all know what is bad for ourselves

Yes we know that but the harm I am conscious of in myself is
something I cannot inflict on others said Prince Andrew growing more
and more animated and evidently wishing to express his new outlook to
Pierre He spoke in French I only know two very real evils in life
remorse and illness The only good is the absence of those evils To
live for myself avoiding those two evils is my whole philosophy now

And love of ones neighbor and selfsacrifice began Pierre No I
cant agree with you To live only so as not to do evil and not to have
to repent is not enough I lived like that I lived for myself and
ruined my life And only now when I am living or at least trying
Pierres modesty made him correct himself to live for others only
now have I understood all the happiness of life No I shall not agree
with you and you do not really believe what you are saying Prince
Andrew looked silently at Pierre with an ironic smile

When you see my sister Princess Mary youll get on with her he
said Perhaps you are right for yourself he added after a short
pause but everyone lives in his own way You lived for yourself and
say you nearly ruined your life and only found happiness when you began
living for others I experienced just the reverse I lived for
gloryAnd after all what is glory The same love of others a desire to
do something for them a desire for their approvalSo I lived for
others and not almost but quite ruined my life And I have become
calmer since I began to live only for myself

But what do you mean by living only for yourself asked Pierre
growing excited What about your son your sister and your father

But thats just the same as myselfthey are not others explained
Prince Andrew The others ones neighbors le prochain as you and
Princess Mary call it are the chief source of all error and evil Le
prochainyour Kiev peasants to whom you want to do good

And he looked at Pierre with a mocking challenging expression He
evidently wished to draw him on

You are joking replied Pierre growing more and more excited What
error or evil can there be in my wishing to do good and even doing a
littlethough I did very little and did it very badly What evil can
there be in it if unfortunate people our serfs people like ourselves
were growing up and dying with no idea of God and truth beyond
ceremonies and meaningless prayers and are now instructed in a
comforting belief in future life retribution recompense and
consolation What evil and error are there in it if people were dying
of disease without help while material assistance could so easily be
rendered and I supplied them with a doctor a hospital and an asylum
for the aged And is it not a palpable unquestionable good if a
peasant or a woman with a baby has no rest day or night and I give
them rest and leisure said Pierre hurrying and lisping And I have
done that though badly and to a small extent but I have done something
toward it and you cannot persuade me that it was not a good action and
more than that you cant make me believe that you do not think so
yourself And the main thing is he continued that I know and know
for certain that the enjoyment of doing this good is the only sure
happiness in life

Yes if you put it like that its quite a different matter said
Prince Andrew I build a house and lay out a garden and you build
hospitals The one and the other may serve as a pastime But whats
right and whats good must be judged by one who knows all but not by
us Well you want an argument he added come on then

They rose from the table and sat down in the entrance porch which served
as a veranda

Come lets argue then said Prince Andrew You talk of schools he
went on crooking a finger education and so forth that is you want
to raise him pointing to a peasant who passed by them taking off his
cap from his animal condition and awaken in him spiritual needs while
it seems to me that animal happiness is the only happiness possible and
that is just what you want to deprive him of I envy him but you want
to make him what I am without giving him my means Then you say
lighten his toil But as I see it physical labor is as essential to
him as much a condition of his existence as mental activity is to you
or me You cant help thinking I go to bed after two in the morning
thoughts come and I cant sleep but toss about till dawn because I
think and cant help thinking just as he cant help plowing and mowing
if he didnt he would go to the drink shop or fall ill Just as I could
not stand his terrible physical labor but should die of it in a week so
he could not stand my physical idleness but would grow fat and die The
third thingwhat else was it you talked about and Prince Andrew
crooked a third finger Ah yes hospitals medicine He has a fit he
is dying and you come and bleed him and patch him up He will drag
about as a cripple a burden to everybody for another ten years It
would be far easier and simpler for him to die Others are being born
and there are plenty of them as it is It would be different if you
grudged losing a laborerthats how I regard himbut you want to cure
him from love of him And he does not want that And besides what a
notion that medicine ever cured anyone Killed them yes said he
frowning angrily and turning away from Pierre

Prince Andrew expressed his ideas so clearly and distinctly that it was
evident he had reflected on this subject more than once and he spoke
readily and rapidly like a man who has not talked for a long time His
glance became more animated as his conclusions became more hopeless

Oh that is dreadful dreadful said Pierre I dont understand how
one can live with such ideas I had such moments myself not long ago in
Moscow and when traveling but at such times I collapsed so that I dont
live at alleverything seems hateful to me myself most of all Then I
dont eat dont wash and how is it with you

Why not wash That is not cleanly said Prince Andrew on the
contrary one must try to make ones life as pleasant as possible Im
alive that is not my fault so I must live out my life as best I can
without hurting others

But with such ideas what motive have you for living One would sit
without moving undertaking nothing

Life as it is leaves one no peace I should be thankful to do nothing
but here on the one hand the local nobility have done me the honor to
choose me to be their marshal it was all I could do to get out of it
They could not understand that I have not the necessary qualifications
for itthe kind of goodnatured fussy shallowness necessary for the
position Then theres this house which must be built in order to have
a nook of ones own in which to be quiet And now theres this
recruiting

Why arent you serving in the army

After Austerlitz said Prince Andrew gloomily No thank you very
much I have promised myself not to serve again in the active Russian
army And I wontnot even if Bonaparte were here at Smolensk
threatening Bald Hillseven then I wouldnt serve in the Russian army
Well as I was saying he continued recovering his composure now
theres this recruiting My father is chief in command of the Third
District and my only way of avoiding active service is to serve under
him

Then you are serving

I am

He paused a little while

And why do you serve

Why for this reason My father is one of the most remarkable men of
his time But he is growing old and though not exactly cruel he has too
energetic a character He is so accustomed to unlimited power that he is
terrible and now he has this authority of a commanderinchief of the
recruiting granted by the Emperor If I had been two hours late a
fortnight ago he would have had a paymasters clerk at Yukhnovna
hanged said Prince Andrew with a smile So I am serving because I
alone have any influence with my father and now and then can save him
from actions which would torment him afterwards

Well there you see

Yes but it is not as you imagine Prince Andrew continued I did
not and do not in the least care about that scoundrel of a clerk who
had stolen some boots from the recruits I should even have been very
glad to see him hanged but I was sorry for my fatherthat again is for
myself

Prince Andrew grew more and more animated His eyes glittered feverishly
while he tried to prove to Pierre that in his actions there was no
desire to do good to his neighbor

There now you wish to liberate your serfs he continued that is a
very good thing but not for youI dont suppose you ever had anyone
flogged or sent to Siberiaand still less for your serfs If they are
beaten flogged or sent to Siberia I dont suppose they are any the
worse off In Siberia they lead the same animal life and the stripes on
their bodies heal and they are happy as before But it is a good thing
for proprietors who perish morally bring remorse upon themselves
stifle this remorse and grow callous as a result of being able to
inflict punishments justly and unjustly It is those people I pity and
for their sake I should like to liberate the serfs You may not have
seen but I have seen how good men brought up in those traditions of
unlimited power in time when they grow more irritable become cruel and
harsh are conscious of it but cannot restrain themselves and grow more
and more miserable

Prince Andrew spoke so earnestly that Pierre could not help thinking
that these thoughts had been suggested to Prince Andrew by his fathers
case

He did not reply

So thats what Im sorry forhuman dignity peace of mind purity and
not the serfs backs and foreheads which beat and shave as you may
always remain the same backs and foreheads

No no A thousand times no I shall never agree with you said
Pierre





CHAPTER XII

In the evening Andrew and Pierre got into the open carriage and drove to
Bald Hills Prince Andrew glancing at Pierre broke the silence now and
then with remarks which showed that he was in a good temper

Pointing to the fields he spoke of the improvements he was making in
his husbandry

Pierre remained gloomily silent answering in monosyllables and
apparently immersed in his own thoughts

He was thinking that Prince Andrew was unhappy had gone astray did not
see the true light and that he Pierre ought to aid enlighten and
raise him But as soon as he thought of what he should say he felt that
Prince Andrew with one word one argument would upset all his teaching
and he shrank from beginning afraid of exposing to possible ridicule
what to him was precious and sacred

No but why do you think so Pierre suddenly began lowering his head
and looking like a bull about to charge why do you think so You
should not think so

Think What about asked Prince Andrew with surprise

About life about mans destiny It cant be so I myself thought like
that and do you know what saved me Freemasonry No dont smile
Freemasonry is not a religious ceremonial sect as I thought it was
Freemasonry is the best expression of the best the eternal aspects of
humanity

And he began to explain Freemasonry as he understood it to Prince
Andrew He said that Freemasonry is the teaching of Christianity freed
from the bonds of State and Church a teaching of equality brotherhood
and love

Only our holy brotherhood has the real meaning of life all the rest is
a dream said Pierre Understand my dear fellow that outside this
union all is filled with deceit and falsehood and I agree with you that
nothing is left for an intelligent and good man but to live out his
life like you merely trying not to harm others But make our
fundamental convictions your own join our brotherhood give yourself up
to us let yourself be guided and you will at once feel yourself as I
have felt myself a part of that vast invisible chain the beginning of
which is hidden in heaven said Pierre

Prince Andrew looking straight in front of him listened in silence to
Pierres words More than once when the noise of the wheels prevented
his catching what Pierre said he asked him to repeat it and by the
peculiar glow that came into Prince Andrews eyes and by his silence
Pierre saw that his words were not in vain and that Prince Andrew would
not interrupt him or laugh at what he said

They reached a river that had overflowed its banks and which they had to
cross by ferry While the carriage and horses were being placed on it
they also stepped on the raft

Prince Andrew leaning his arms on the raft railing gazed silently at
the flooding waters glittering in the setting sun

Well what do you think about it Pierre asked Why are you silent

What do I think about it I am listening to you Its all very well
You say join our brotherhood and we will show you the aim of life the
destiny of man and the laws which govern the world But who are we
Men How is it you know everything Why do I alone not see what you see
You see a reign of goodness and truth on earth but I dont see it

Pierre interrupted him

Do you believe in a future life he asked

A future life Prince Andrew repeated but Pierre giving him no time
to reply took the repetition for a denial the more readily as he knew
Prince Andrews former atheistic convictions

You say you cant see a reign of goodness and truth on earth Nor could
I and it cannot be seen if one looks on our life here as the end of
everything On earth here on this earth Pierre pointed to the
fields there is no truth all is false and evil but in the universe
in the whole universe there is a kingdom of truth and we who are now
the children of earth areeternallychildren of the whole universe
Dont I feel in my soul that I am part of this vast harmonious whole
Dont I feel that I form one link one step between the lower and
higher beings in this vast harmonious multitude of beings in whom the
Deitythe Supreme Power if you prefer the termis manifest If I see
clearly see that ladder leading from plant to man why should I suppose
it breaks off at me and does not go farther and farther I feel that I
cannot vanish since nothing vanishes in this world but that I shall
always exist and always have existed I feel that beyond me and above me
there are spirits and that in this world there is truth

Yes that is Herders theory said Prince Andrew but it is not that
which can convince me dear friendlife and death are what convince
What convinces is when one sees a being dear to one bound up with ones
own life before whom one was to blame and had hoped to make it right
Prince Andrews voice trembled and he turned away and suddenly that
being is seized with pain suffers and ceases to exist Why It
cannot be that there is no answer And I believe there is Thats
what convinces that is what has convinced me said Prince Andrew

Yes yes of course said Pierre isnt that what Im saying

No All I say is that it is not argument that convinces me of the
necessity of a future life but this when you go hand in hand with
someone and all at once that person vanishes there into nowhere and
you yourself are left facing that abyss and look in And I have looked
in

Well thats it then You know that there is a there and there is a
Someone There is the future life The Someone isGod

Prince Andrew did not reply The carriage and horses had long since been
taken off onto the farther bank and reharnessed The sun had sunk half
below the horizon and an evening frost was starring the puddles near the
ferry but Pierre and Andrew to the astonishment of the footmen
coachmen and ferrymen still stood on the raft and talked

If there is a God and future life there is truth and good and mans
highest happiness consists in striving to attain them We must live we
must love and we must believe that we live not only today on this scrap
of earth but have lived and shall live forever there in the Whole
said Pierre and he pointed to the sky

Prince Andrew stood leaning on the railing of the raft listening to
Pierre and he gazed with his eyes fixed on the red reflection of the
sun gleaming on the blue waters There was perfect stillness Pierre
became silent The raft had long since stopped and only the waves of the
current beat softly against it below Prince Andrew felt as if the sound
of the waves kept up a refrain to Pierres words whispering

It is true believe it

He sighed and glanced with a radiant childlike tender look at
Pierres face flushed and rapturous but yet shy before his superior
friend

Yes if it only were so said Prince Andrew However it is time to
get on he added and stepping off the raft he looked up at the sky
to which Pierre had pointed and for the first time since Austerlitz saw
that high everlasting sky he had seen while lying on that battlefield
and something that had long been slumbering something that was best
within him suddenly awoke joyful and youthful in his soul It
vanished as soon as he returned to the customary conditions of his life
but he knew that this feeling which he did not know how to develop
existed within him His meeting with Pierre formed an epoch in Prince
Andrews life Though outwardly he continued to live in the same old
way inwardly he began a new life





CHAPTER XIII

It was getting dusk when Prince Andrew and Pierre drove up to the front
entrance of the house at Bald Hills As they approached the house
Prince Andrew with a smile drew Pierres attention to a commotion going
on at the back porch A woman bent with age with a wallet on her back
and a short longhaired young man in a black garment had rushed back
to the gate on seeing the carriage driving up Two women ran out after
them and all four looking round at the carriage ran in dismay up the
steps of the back porch

Those are Marys Gods folk said Prince Andrew They have mistaken
us for my father This is the one matter in which she disobeys him He
orders these pilgrims to be driven away but she receives them

But what are Gods folk asked Pierre

Prince Andrew had no time to answer The servants came out to meet them
and he asked where the old prince was and whether he was expected back
soon

The old prince had gone to the town and was expected back any minute

Prince Andrew led Pierre to his own apartments which were always kept
in perfect order and readiness for him in his fathers house he himself
went to the nursery

Let us go and see my sister he said to Pierre when he returned I
have not found her yet she is hiding now sitting with her Gods
folk It will serve her right she will be confused but you will see
her Gods folk Its really very curious

What are Gods folk asked Pierre

Come and youll see for yourself

Princess Mary really was disconcerted and red patches came on her face
when they went in In her snug room with lamps burning before the icon
stand a young lad with a long nose and long hair wearing a monks
cassock sat on the sofa beside her behind a samovar Near them in an
armchair sat a thin shriveled old woman with a meek expression on
her childlike face

Andrew why didnt you warn me said the princess with mild reproach
as she stood before her pilgrims like a hen before her chickens

Charmee de vous voir Je suis tres contente de vous voir she said
to Pierre as he kissed her hand She had known him as a child and now
his friendship with Andrew his misfortune with his wife and above all
his kindly simple face disposed her favorably toward him She looked at
him with her beautiful radiant eyes and seemed to say I like you very
much but please dont laugh at my people After exchanging the first
greetings they sat down

 Delighted to see you I am very glad to see you

Ah and Ivanushka is here too said Prince Andrew glancing with a
smile at the young pilgrim

Andrew said Princess Mary imploringly Il faut que vous sachiez que
cest une femme said Prince Andrew to Pierre

Andrew au nom de Dieu 2 Princess Mary repeated

 You must know that this is a woman

 2 For heavens sake

It was evident that Prince Andrews ironical tone toward the pilgrims
and Princess Marys helpless attempts to protect them were their
customary longestablished relations on the matter

Mais ma bonne amie said Prince Andrew vous devriez au contraire
mtre reconnaissante de ce que jexplique a Pierre votre intimit avec
ce jeune homme

 But my dear you ought on the contrary to be grateful to me for
explaining to Pierre your intimacy with this young man

Really said Pierre gazing over his spectacles with curiosity and
seriousness for which Princess Mary was specially grateful to him into
Ivanushkas face who seeing that she was being spoken about looked
round at them all with crafty eyes

Princess Marys embarrassment on her peoples account was quite
unnecessary They were not in the least abashed The old woman lowering
her eyes but casting side glances at the newcomers had turned her cup
upside down and placed a nibbled bit of sugar beside it and sat quietly
in her armchair though hoping to be offered another cup of tea
Ivanushka sipping out of her saucer looked with sly womanish eyes from
under her brows at the young men

Where have you been To Kiev Prince Andrew asked the old woman

I have good sir she answered garrulously Just at Christmastime I
was deemed worthy to partake of the holy and heavenly sacrament at the
shrine of the saint And now Im from Kolyazin master where a great
and wonderful blessing has been revealed

And was Ivanushka with you

I go by myself benefactor said Ivanushka trying to speak in a bass
voice I only came across Pelageya in Yukhnovo

Pelageya interrupted her companion she evidently wished to tell what
she had seen

In Kolyazin master a wonderful blessing has been revealed

What is it Some new relics asked Prince Andrew

Andrew do leave off said Princess Mary Dont tell him Pelageya

No why not my dear why shouldnt I I like him He is kind he is
one of Gods chosen hes a benefactor he once gave me ten rubles I
remember When I was in Kiev Crazy Cyril says to me hes one of Gods
own and goes barefoot summer and winter he says Why are you not
going to the right place Go to Kolyazin where a wonderworking icon of
the Holy Mother of God has been revealed On hearing those words I said
goodby to the holy folk and went

All were silent only the pilgrim woman went on in measured tones
drawing in her breath

So I come master and the people say to me A great blessing has been
revealed holy oil trickles from the cheeks of our blessed Mother the
Holy Virgin Mother of God

All right all right you can tell us afterwards said Princess Mary
flushing

Let me ask her said Pierre Did you see it yourselves he inquired

Oh yes master I was found worthy Such a brightness on the face like
the light of heaven and from the blessed Mothers cheek it drops and
drops

But dear me that must be a fraud said Pierre navely who had
listened attentively to the pilgrim

Oh master what are you saying exclaimed the horrified Pelageya
turning to Princess Mary for support

They impose on the people he repeated

Lord Jesus Christ exclaimed the pilgrim woman crossing herself Oh
dont speak so master There was a general who did not believe and
said The monks cheat and as soon as hed said it he went blind And
he dreamed that the Holy Virgin Mother of the Kiev catacombs came to him
and said Believe in me and I will make you whole So he begged Take
me to her take me to her Its the real truth Im telling you I saw
it myself So he was brought quite blind straight to her and he goes
up to her and falls down and says Make me whole says he and Ill
give thee what the Tsar bestowed on me I saw it myself master the
star is fixed into the icon Well and what do you think He received
his sight Its a sin to speak so God will punish you she said
admonishingly turning to Pierre

How did the star get into the icon Pierre asked

And was the Holy Mother promoted to the rank of general said Prince
Andrew with a smile

Pelageya suddenly grew quite pale and clasped her hands

Oh master master what a sin And you who have a son she began her
pallor suddenly turning to a vivid red Master what have you said God
forgive you And she crossed herself Lord forgive him My dear what
does it mean she asked turning to Princess Mary She got up and
almost crying began to arrange her wallet She evidently felt
frightened and ashamed to have accepted charity in a house where such
things could be said and was at the same time sorry to have now to
forgo the charity of this house

Now why need you do it said Princess Mary Why did you come to
me

Come Pelageya I was joking said Pierre Princesse ma parole je
nai pas voulu loffenser I did not mean anything I was only
joking he said smiling shyly and trying to efface his offense It
was all my fault and Andrew was only joking

 Princess on my word I did not wish to offend her

Pelageya stopped doubtfully but in Pierres face there was such a look
of sincere penitence and Prince Andrew glanced so meekly now at her and
now at Pierre that she was gradually reassured





CHAPTER XIV

The pilgrim woman was appeased and being encouraged to talk gave a
long account of Father Amphilochus who led so holy a life that his
hands smelled of incense and how on her last visit to Kiev some monks
she knew let her have the keys of the catacombs and how she taking
some dried bread with her had spent two days in the catacombs with the
saints Id pray awhile to one ponder awhile then go on to another
Id sleep a bit and then again go and kiss the relics and there was
such peace all around such blessedness that one dont want to come
out even into the light of heaven again

Pierre listened to her attentively and seriously Prince Andrew went out
of the room and then leaving Gods folk to finish their tea
Princess Mary took Pierre into the drawing room

You are very kind she said to him

Oh I really did not mean to hurt her feelings I understand them so
well and have the greatest respect for them

Princess Mary looked at him silently and smiled affectionately

I have known you a long time you see and am as fond of you as of a
brother she said How do you find Andrew she added hurriedly not
giving him time to reply to her affectionate words I am very anxious
about him His health was better in the winter but last spring his
wound reopened and the doctor said he ought to go away for a cure And I
am also very much afraid for him spiritually He has not a character
like us women who when we suffer can weep away our sorrows He keeps
it all within him Today he is cheerful and in good spirits but that is
the effect of your visithe is not often like that If you could
persuade him to go abroad He needs activity and this quiet regular
life is very bad for him Others dont notice it but I see it

Toward ten oclock the men servants rushed to the front door hearing
the bells of the old princes carriage approaching Prince Andrew and
Pierre also went out into the porch

Whos that asked the old prince noticing Pierre as he got out of the
carriage

Ah Very glad Kiss me he said having learned who the young stranger
was

The old prince was in a good temper and very gracious to Pierre

Before supper Prince Andrew coming back to his fathers study found
him disputing hotly with his visitor Pierre was maintaining that a time
would come when there would be no more wars The old prince disputed it
chaffingly but without getting angry

Drain the blood from mens veins and put in water instead then there
will be no more war Old womens nonsenseold womens nonsense he
repeated but still he patted Pierre affectionately on the shoulder and
then went up to the table where Prince Andrew evidently not wishing to
join in the conversation was looking over the papers his father had
brought from town The old prince went up to him and began to talk
business

The marshal a Count Rostv hasnt sent half his contingent He came
to town and wanted to invite me to dinnerI gave him a pretty dinner
And there look at this Well my boy the old prince went on
addressing his son and patting Pierre on the shoulder A fine
fellowyour friendI like him He stirs me up Another says clever
things and one doesnt care to listen but this one talks rubbish yet
stirs an old fellow up Well go Get along Perhaps Ill come and sit
with you at supper Well have another dispute Make friends with my
little fool Princess Mary he shouted after Pierre through the door

Only now on his visit to Bald Hills did Pierre fully realize the
strength and charm of his friendship with Prince Andrew That charm was
not expressed so much in his relations with him as with all his family
and with the household With the stern old prince and the gentle timid
Princess Mary though he had scarcely known them Pierre at once felt
like an old friend They were all fond of him already Not only Princess
Mary who had been won by his gentleness with the pilgrims gave him her
most radiant looks but even the oneyearold Prince Nicholas as his
grandfather called him smiled at Pierre and let himself be taken in his
arms and Michael Ivnovich and Mademoiselle Bourienne looked at him
with pleasant smiles when he talked to the old prince

The old prince came in to supper this was evidently on Pierres
account And during the two days of the young mans visit he was
extremely kind to him and told him to visit them again

When Pierre had gone and the members of the household met together they
began to express their opinions of him as people always do after a new
acquaintance has left but as seldom happens no one said anything but
what was good of him





CHAPTER XV

When returning from his leave Rostv felt for the first time how
close was the bond that united him to Denisov and the whole regiment

On approaching it Rostv felt as he had done when approaching his home
in Moscow When he saw the first hussar with the unbuttoned uniform of
his regiment when he recognized redhaired Dementyev and saw the picket
ropes of the roan horses when Lavrushka gleefully shouted to his
master The count has come and Denisov who had been asleep on his
bed ran all disheveled out of the mud hut to embrace him and the
officers collected round to greet the new arrival Rostv experienced
the same feeling as when his mother his father and his sister had
embraced him and tears of joy choked him so that he could not speak
The regiment was also a home and as unalterably dear and precious as
his parents house

When he had reported himself to the commander of the regiment and had
been reassigned to his former squadron had been on duty and had gone
out foraging when he had again entered into all the little interests of
the regiment and felt himself deprived of liberty and bound in one
narrow unchanging frame he experienced the same sense of peace of
moral support and the same sense of being at home here in his own
place as he had felt under the parental roof But here was none of all
that turmoil of the world at large where he did not know his right
place and took mistaken decisions here was no Snya with whom he ought
or ought not to have an explanation here was no possibility of going
there or not going there here there were not twentyfour hours in the
day which could be spent in such a variety of ways there was not that
innumerable crowd of people of whom not one was nearer to him or farther
from him than another there were none of those uncertain and undefined
money relations with his father and nothing to recall that terrible
loss to Dlokhov Here in the regiment all was clear and simple The
whole world was divided into two unequal parts one our Pvlograd
regiment the other all the rest And the rest was no concern of his
In the regiment everything was definite who was lieutenant who
captain who was a good fellow who a bad one and most of all who was
a comrade The canteenkeeper gave one credit ones pay came every four
months there was nothing to think out or decide you had only to do
nothing that was considered bad in the Pvlograd regiment and when
given an order to do what was clearly distinctly and definitely
orderedand all would be well

Having once more entered into the definite conditions of this regimental
life Rostv felt the joy and relief a tired man feels on lying down to
rest Life in the regiment during this campaign was all the pleasanter
for him because after his loss to Dlokhov for which in spite of all
his familys efforts to console him he could not forgive himself he
had made up his mind to atone for his fault by serving not as he had
done before but really well and by being a perfectly firstrate
comrade and officerin a word a splendid man altogether a thing which
seemed so difficult out in the world but so possible in the regiment

After his losses he had determined to pay back his debt to his parents
in five years He received ten thousand rubles a year but now resolved
to take only two thousand and leave the rest to repay the debt to his
parents

Our army after repeated retreats and advances and battles at Pultusk
and PreussischEylau was concentrated near Bartenstein It was awaiting
the Emperors arrival and the beginning of a new campaign

The Pvlograd regiment belonging to that part of the army which had
served in the 1805 campaign had been recruiting up to strength in
Russia and arrived too late to take part in the first actions of the
campaign It had been neither at Pultusk nor at PreussischEylau and
when it joined the army in the field in the second half of the campaign
was attached to Platovs division

Platovs division was acting independently of the main army Several
times parts of the Pvlograd regiment had exchanged shots with the
enemy had taken prisoners and once had even captured Marshal Oudinots
carriages In April the Pvlograds were stationed immovably for some
weeks near a totally ruined and deserted German village

A thaw had set in it was muddy and cold the ice on the river broke
and the roads became impassable For days neither provisions for the men
nor fodder for the horses had been issued As no transports could
arrive the men dispersed about the abandoned and deserted villages
searching for potatoes but found few even of these

Everything had been eaten up and the inhabitants had all fledif any
remained they were worse than beggars and nothing more could be taken
from them even the soldiers usually pitiless enough instead of taking
anything from them often gave them the last of their rations

The Pvlograd regiment had had only two men wounded in action but had
lost nearly half its men from hunger and sickness In the hospitals
death was so certain that soldiers suffering from fever or the swelling
that came from bad food preferred to remain on duty and hardly able to
drag their legs went to the front rather than to the hospitals When
spring came on the soldiers found a plant just showing out of the
ground that looked like asparagus which for some reason they called
Mashkas sweet root It was very bitter but they wandered about the
fields seeking it and dug it out with their sabers and ate it though
they were ordered not to do so as it was a noxious plant That spring a
new disease broke out among the soldiers a swelling of the arms legs
and face which the doctors attributed to eating this root But in spite
of all this the soldiers of Denisovs squadron fed chiefly on Mashkas
sweet root because it was the second week that the last of the
biscuits were being doled out at the rate of half a pound a man and the
last potatoes received had sprouted and frozen

The horses also had been fed for a fortnight on straw from the thatched
roofs and had become terribly thin though still covered with tufts of
felty winter hair

Despite this destitution the soldiers and officers went on living just
as usual Despite their pale swollen faces and tattered uniforms the
hussars formed line for roll call kept things in order groomed their
horses polished their arms brought in straw from the thatched roofs in
place of fodder and sat down to dine round the caldrons from which they
rose up hungry joking about their nasty food and their hunger As
usual in their spare time they lit bonfires steamed themselves before
them naked smoked picked out and baked sprouting rotten potatoes told
and listened to stories of Potmkins and Suvrovs campaigns or to
legends of Alesha the Sly or the priests laborer Mikolka

The officers as usual lived in twos and threes in the roofless half
ruined houses The seniors tried to collect straw and potatoes and in
general food for the men The younger ones occupied themselves as
before some playing cards there was plenty of money though there was
no food some with more innocent games such as quoits and skittles
The general trend of the campaign was rarely spoken of partly because
nothing certain was known about it partly because there was a vague
feeling that in the main it was going badly

Rostv lived as before with Denisov and since their furlough they had
become more friendly than ever Denisov never spoke of Rostvs family
but by the tender friendship his commander showed him Rostv felt that
the elder hussars luckless love for Natsha played a part in
strengthening their friendship Denisov evidently tried to expose Rostv
to danger as seldom as possible and after an action greeted his safe
return with evident joy On one of his foraging expeditions in a
deserted and ruined village to which he had come in search of
provisions Rostv found a family consisting of an old Pole and his
daughter with an infant in arms They were half clad hungry too weak
to get away on foot and had no means of obtaining a conveyance Rostv
brought them to his quarters placed them in his own lodging and kept
them for some weeks while the old man was recovering One of his
comrades talking of women began chaffing Rostv saying that he was
more wily than any of them and that it would not be a bad thing if he
introduced to them the pretty Polish girl he had saved Rostv took the
joke as an insult flared up and said such unpleasant things to the
officer that it was all Denisov could do to prevent a duel When the
officer had gone away Denisov who did not himself know what Rostvs
relations with the Polish girl might be began to upbraid him for his
quickness of temper and Rostv replied

Say what you like She is like a sister to me and I cant tell you
how it offended me because well for that reason

Denisov patted him on the shoulder and began rapidly pacing the room
without looking at Rostv as was his way at moments of deep feeling

Ah what a mad bweed you Wostovs are he muttered and Rostv noticed
tears in his eyes





CHAPTER XVI

In April the troops were enlivened by news of the Emperors arrival but
Rostv had no chance of being present at the review he held at
Bartenstein as the Pvlograds were at the outposts far beyond that
place

They were bivouacking Denisov and Rostv were living in an earth hut
dug out for them by the soldiers and roofed with branches and turf The
hut was made in the following manner which had then come into vogue A
trench was dug three and a half feet wide four feet eight inches deep
and eight feet long At one end of the trench steps were cut out and
these formed the entrance and vestibule The trench itself was the room
in which the lucky ones such as the squadron commander had a board
lying on piles at the end opposite the entrance to serve as a table On
each side of the trench the earth was cut out to a breadth of about two
and a half feet and this did duty for bedsteads and couches The roof
was so constructed that one could stand up in the middle of the trench
and could even sit up on the beds if one drew close to the table
Denisov who was living luxuriously because the soldiers of his squadron
liked him had also a board in the roof at the farther end with a piece
of broken but mended glass in it for a window When it was very cold
embers from the soldiers campfire were placed on a bent sheet of iron
on the steps in the reception roomas Denisov called that part of the
hutand it was then so warm that the officers of whom there were always
some with Denisov and Rostv sat in their shirt sleeves

In April Rostv was on orderly duty One morning between seven and
eight returning after a sleepless night he sent for embers changed
his rainsoaked underclothes said his prayers drank tea got warm
then tidied up the things on the table and in his own corner and his
face glowing from exposure to the wind and with nothing on but his
shirt lay down on his back putting his arms under his head He was
pleasantly considering the probability of being promoted in a few days
for his last reconnoitering expedition and was awaiting Denisov who
had gone out somewhere and with whom he wanted a talk

Suddenly he heard Denisov shouting in a vibrating voice behind the hut
evidently much excited Rostv moved to the window to see whom he was
speaking to and saw the quartermaster Topcheenko

I ordered you not to let them eat that Mashka woot stuff Denisov was
shouting And I saw with my own eyes how Lazarchuk bwought some fwom
the fields

I have given the order again and again your honor but they dont
obey answered the quartermaster

Rostv lay down again on his bed and thought complacently Let him fuss
and bustle now my jobs done and Im lying downcapitally He could
hear that Lavrushkathat sly bold orderly of Denisovswas talking as
well as the quartermaster Lavrushka was saying something about loaded
wagons biscuits and oxen he had seen when he had gone out for
provisions

Then Denisovs voice was heard shouting farther and farther away
Saddle Second platoon

Where are they off to now thought Rostv

Five minutes later Denisov came into the hut climbed with muddy boots
on the bed lit his pipe furiously scattered his things about took his
leaded whip buckled on his saber and went out again In answer to
Rostvs inquiry where he was going he answered vaguely and crossly
that he had some business

Let God and our gweat monarch judge me afterwards said Denisov going
out and Rostv heard the hoofs of several horses splashing through the
mud He did not even trouble to find out where Denisov had gone Having
got warm in his corner he fell asleep and did not leave the hut till
toward evening Denisov had not yet returned The weather had cleared
up and near the next hut two officers and a cadet were playing svayka
laughing as they threw their missiles which buried themselves in the
soft mud Rostv joined them In the middle of the game the officers
saw some wagons approaching with fifteen hussars on their skinny horses
behind them The wagons escorted by the hussars drew up to the picket
ropes and a crowd of hussars surrounded them

There now Denisov has been worrying said Rostv and here are the
provisions

So they are said the officers Wont the soldiers be glad

A little behind the hussars came Denisov accompanied by two infantry
officers with whom he was talking

Rostv went to meet them

I warn you Captain one of the officers a short thin man evidently
very angry was saying

Havent I told you I wont give them up replied Denisov

You will answer for it Captain It is mutinyseizing the transport of
ones own army Our men have had nothing to eat for two days

And mine have had nothing for two weeks said Denisov

It is robbery Youll answer for it sir said the infantry officer
raising his voice

Now what are you pestewing me for cried Denisov suddenly losing his
temper I shall answer for it and not you and youd better not buzz
about here till you get hurt Be off Go he shouted at the officers

Very well then shouted the little officer undaunted and not riding
away If you are determined to rob Ill

Go to the devil quick mach while youre safe and sound and Denisov
turned his horse on the officer

Very well very well muttered the officer threateningly and turning
his horse he trotted away jolting in his saddle

A dog astwide a fence A weal dog astwide a fence shouted Denisov
after him the most insulting expression a cavalryman can address to a
mounted infantryman and riding up to Rostv he burst out laughing

Ive taken twansports from the infantwy by force he said After all
cant let our men starve

The wagons that had reached the hussars had been consigned to an
infantry regiment but learning from Lavrushka that the transport was
unescorted Denisov with his hussars had seized it by force The
soldiers had biscuits dealt out to them freely and they even shared
them with the other squadrons

The next day the regimental commander sent for Denisov and holding his
fingers spread out before his eyes said

This is how I look at this affair I know nothing about it and wont
begin proceedings but I advise you to ride over to the staff and settle
the business there in the commissariat department and if possible sign a
receipt for such and such stores received If not as the demand was
booked against an infantry regiment there will be a row and the affair
may end badly

From the regimental commanders Denisov rode straight to the staff with
a sincere desire to act on this advice In the evening he came back to
his dugout in a state such as Rostv had never yet seen him in Denisov
could not speak and gasped for breath When Rostv asked what was the
matter he only uttered some incoherent oaths and threats in a hoarse
feeble voice

Alarmed at Denisovs condition Rostv suggested that he should undress
drink some water and send for the doctor

Twy me for wobbewy oh Some more water Let them twy me but Ill
always thwash scoundwels and Ill tell the Empewo Ice he
muttered

The regimental doctor when he came said it was absolutely necessary to
bleed Denisov A deep saucer of black blood was taken from his hairy arm
and only then was he able to relate what had happened to him

I get there began Denisov Now then wheres your chiefs
quarters They were pointed out Please to wait Ive widden twenty
miles and have duties to attend to and no time to wait Announce me
Vewy well so out comes their head chiefalso took it into his head to
lecture me Its wobbewyWobbewy I say is not done by man who
seizes pwovisions to feed his soldiers but by him who takes them to
fill his own pockets Will you please be silent Vewy good Then he
says Go and give a weceipt to the commissioner but your affair will
be passed on to headquarters I go to the commissioner I enter and at
the table who do you think No but wait a bit Who is it thats
starving us shouted Denisov hitting the table with the fist of his
newly bled arm so violently that the table nearly broke down and the
tumblers on it jumped about Telyanin What So its you whos
starving us to death Is it Take this and this and I hit him so pat
stwaight on his snout Ah what a what a and I stated
fwashing him Well Ive had a bit of fun I can tell you cried
Denisov gleeful and yet angry his white teeth showing under his black
mustache Id have killed him if they hadnt taken him away

But what are you shouting for Calm yourself said Rostv Youve set
your arm bleeding afresh Wait we must tie it up again

Denisov was bandaged up again and put to bed Next day he woke calm and
cheerful

But at noon the adjutant of the regiment came into Rostvs and
Denisovs dugout with a grave and serious face and regretfully showed
them a paper addressed to Major Denisov from the regimental commander in
which inquiries were made about yesterdays occurrence The adjutant
told them that the affair was likely to take a very bad turn that a
courtmartial had been appointed and that in view of the severity with
which marauding and insubordination were now regarded degradation to
the ranks would be the best that could be hoped for

The case as represented by the offended parties was that after
seizing the transports Major Denisov being drunk went to the chief
quartermaster and without any provocation called him a thief threatened
to strike him and on being led out had rushed into the office and given
two officials a thrashing and dislocated the arm of one of them

In answer to Rostvs renewed questions Denisov said laughing that he
thought he remembered that some other fellow had got mixed up in it but
that it was all nonsense and rubbish and he did not in the least fear
any kind of trial and that if those scoundrels dared attack him he
would give them an answer that they would not easily forget

Denisov spoke contemptuously of the whole matter but Rostv knew him
too well not to detect that while hiding it from others at heart he
feared a courtmartial and was worried over the affair which was
evidently taking a bad turn Every day letters of inquiry and notices
from the court arrived and on the first of May Denisov was ordered to
hand the squadron over to the next in seniority and appear before the
staff of his division to explain his violence at the commissariat
office On the previous day Platov reconnoitered with two Cossack
regiments and two squadrons of hussars Denisov as was his wont rode
out in front of the outposts parading his courage A bullet fired by a
French sharpshooter hit him in the fleshy part of his leg Perhaps at
another time Denisov would not have left the regiment for so slight a
wound but now he took advantage of it to excuse himself from appearing
at the staff and went into hospital





CHAPTER XVII

In June the battle of Friedland was fought in which the Pvlograds did
not take part and after that an armistice was proclaimed Rostv who
felt his friends absence very much having no news of him since he left
and feeling very anxious about his wound and the progress of his
affairs took advantage of the armistice to get leave to visit Denisov
in hospital

The hospital was in a small Prussian town that had been twice devastated
by Russian and French troops Because it was summer when it is so
beautiful out in the fields the little town presented a particularly
dismal appearance with its broken roofs and fences its foul streets
tattered inhabitants and the sick and drunken soldiers wandering about

The hospital was in a brick building with some of the window frames and
panes broken and a courtyard surrounded by the remains of a wooden fence
that had been pulled to pieces Several bandaged soldiers with pale
swollen faces were sitting or walking about in the sunshine in the
yard

Directly Rostv entered the door he was enveloped by a smell of
putrefaction and hospital air On the stairs he met a Russian army
doctor smoking a cigar The doctor was followed by a Russian assistant

I cant tear myself to pieces the doctor was saying Come to Makar
Alexeevich in the evening I shall be there

The assistant asked some further questions

Oh do the best you can Isnt it all the same The doctor noticed
Rostv coming upstairs

What do you want sir said the doctor What do you want The bullets
having spared you do you want to try typhus This is a pesthouse sir

How so asked Rostv

Typhus sir Its death to go in Only we two Makeev and I he
pointed to the assistant keep on here Some five of us doctors have
died in this place When a new one comes he is done for in a week
said the doctor with evident satisfaction Prussian doctors have been
invited here but our allies dont like it at all

Rostv explained that he wanted to see Major Denisov of the hussars who
was wounded

I dont know I cant tell you sir Only think I am alone in charge
of three hospitals with more than four hundred patients Its well that
the charitable Prussian ladies send us two pounds of coffee and some
lint each month or we should be lost he laughed Four hundred sir
and theyre always sending me fresh ones There are four hundred Eh
he asked turning to the assistant

The assistant looked fagged out He was evidently vexed and impatient
for the talkative doctor to go

Major Denisov Rostv said again He was wounded at Molliten

Dead I fancy Eh Makeev queried the doctor in a tone of
indifference

The assistant however did not confirm the doctors words

Is he tall and with reddish hair asked the doctor

Rostv described Denisovs appearance

There was one like that said the doctor as if pleased That one is
dead I fancy However Ill look up our list We had a list Have you
got it Makeev

Makar Alexeevich has the list answered the assistant But if youll
step into the officers wards youll see for yourself he added
turning to Rostv

Ah youd better not go sir said the doctor or you may have to
stay here yourself

But Rostv bowed himself away from the doctor and asked the assistant to
show him the way

Only dont blame me the doctor shouted up after him

Rostv and the assistant went into the dark corridor The smell was so
strong there that Rostv held his nose and had to pause and collect his
strength before he could go on A door opened to the right and an
emaciated sallow man on crutches barefoot and in underclothing limped
out and leaning against the doorpost looked with glittering envious
eyes at those who were passing Glancing in at the door Rostv saw that
the sick and wounded were lying on the floor on straw and overcoats

May I go in and look

What is there to see said the assistant

But just because the assistant evidently did not want him to go in
Rostv entered the soldiers ward The foul air to which he had already
begun to get used in the corridor was still stronger here It was a
little different more pungent and one felt that this was where it
originated

In the long room brightly lit up by the sun through the large windows
the sick and wounded lay in two rows with their heads to the walls and
leaving a passage in the middle Most of them were unconscious and paid
no attention to the newcomers Those who were conscious raised
themselves or lifted their thin yellow faces and all looked intently at
Rostv with the same expression of hope of relief reproach and envy
of anothers health Rostv went to the middle of the room and looking
through the open doors into the two adjoining rooms saw the same thing
there He stood still looking silently around He had not at all
expected such a sight Just before him almost across the middle of the
passage on the bare floor lay a sick man probably a Cossack to judge
by the cut of his hair The man lay on his back his huge arms and legs
outstretched His face was purple his eyes were rolled back so that
only the whites were seen and on his bare legs and arms which were
still red the veins stood out like cords He was knocking the back of
his head against the floor hoarsely uttering some word which he kept
repeating Rostv listened and made out the word It was drink drink
a drink Rostv glanced round looking for someone who would put this
man back in his place and bring him water

Who looks after the sick here he asked the assistant

Just then a commissariat soldier a hospital orderly came in from the
next room marching stiffly and drew up in front of Rostv

Good day your honor he shouted rolling his eyes at Rostv and
evidently mistaking him for one of the hospital authorities

Get him to his place and give him some water said Rostv pointing to
the Cossack

Yes your honor the soldier replied complacently and rolling his
eyes more than ever he drew himself up still straighter but did not
move

No its impossible to do anything here thought Rostv lowering his
eyes and he was going out but became aware of an intense look fixed on
him on his right and he turned Close to the corner on an overcoat
sat an old unshaven graybearded soldier as thin as a skeleton with a
stern sallow face and eyes intently fixed on Rostv The mans neighbor
on one side whispered something to him pointing at Rostv who noticed
that the old man wanted to speak to him He drew nearer and saw that the
old man had only one leg bent under him the other had been amputated
above the knee His neighbor on the other side who lay motionless some
distance from him with his head thrown back was a young soldier with a
snub nose His pale waxen face was still freckled and his eyes were
rolled back Rostv looked at the young soldier and a cold chill ran
down his back

Why this one seems he began turning to the assistant

And how weve been begging your honor said the old soldier his jaw
quivering Hes been dead since morning After all were men not
dogs

Ill send someone at once He shall be taken awaytaken away at once
said the assistant hurriedly Let us go your honor

Yes yes let us go said Rostv hastily and lowering his eyes and
shrinking he tried to pass unnoticed between the rows of reproachful
envious eyes that were fixed upon him and went out of the room





CHAPTER XVIII

Going along the corridor the assistant led Rostv to the officers
wards consisting of three rooms the doors of which stood open There
were beds in these rooms and the sick and wounded officers were lying or
sitting on them Some were walking about the rooms in hospital dressing
gowns The first person Rostv met in the officers ward was a thin
little man with one arm who was walking about the first room in a
nightcap and hospital dressing gown with a pipe between his teeth
Rostv looked at him trying to remember where he had seen him before

See where weve met again said the little man Tushin Tushin dont
you remember who gave you a lift at Schon Grabern And Ive had a bit
cut off you see he went on with a smile pointing to the empty
sleeve of his dressing gown Looking for Vasli Dmtrich Denisov My
neighbor he added when he heard who Rostv wanted Here here and
Tushin led him into the next room from whence came sounds of several
laughing voices

How can they laugh or even live at all here thought Rostv still
aware of that smell of decomposing flesh that had been so strong in the
soldiers ward and still seeming to see fixed on him those envious
looks which had followed him out from both sides and the face of that
young soldier with eyes rolled back

Denisov lay asleep on his bed with his head under the blanket though it
was nearly noon

Ah Wostov How are you how are you he called out still in the same
voice as in the regiment but Rostv noticed sadly that under this
habitual ease and animation some new sinister hidden feeling showed
itself in the expression of Denisovs face and the intonations of his
voice

His wound though a slight one had not yet healed even now six weeks
after he had been hit His face had the same swollen pallor as the faces
of the other hospital patients but it was not this that struck Rostv
What struck him was that Denisov did not seem glad to see him and
smiled at him unnaturally He did not ask about the regiment nor about
the general state of affairs and when Rostv spoke of these matters did
not listen

Rostv even noticed that Denisov did not like to be reminded of the
regiment or in general of that other free life which was going on
outside the hospital He seemed to try to forget that old life and was
only interested in the affair with the commissariat officers On
Rostvs inquiry as to how the matter stood he at once produced from
under his pillow a paper he had received from the commission and the
rough draft of his answer to it He became animated when he began
reading his paper and specially drew Rostvs attention to the stinging
rejoinders he made to his enemies His hospital companions who had
gathered round Rostva fresh arrival from the world outsidegradually
began to disperse as soon as Denisov began reading his answer Rostv
noticed by their faces that all those gentlemen had already heard that
story more than once and were tired of it Only the man who had the next
bed a stout Uhlan continued to sit on his bed gloomily frowning and
smoking a pipe and little onearmed Tushin still listened shaking his
head disapprovingly In the middle of the reading the Uhlan interrupted
Denisov

But what I say is he said turning to Rostv it would be best
simply to petition the Emperor for pardon They say great rewards will
now be distributed and surely a pardon would be granted

Me petition the Empewo exclaimed Denisov in a voice to which he
tried hard to give the old energy and fire but which sounded like an
expression of irritable impotence What for If I were a wobber I would
ask mercy but Im being courtmartialed for bwinging wobbers to book
Let them twy me Im not afwaid of anyone Ive served the Tsar and my
countwy honowably and have not stolen And am I to be degwaded
Listen Im witing to them stwaight This is what I say If I had
wobbed the Tweasuwy

Its certainly well written said Tushin but thats not the point
Vasli Dmtrich and he also turned to Rostv One has to submit and
Vasli Dmtrich doesnt want to You know the auditor told you it was a
bad business

Well let it be bad said Denisov

The auditor wrote out a petition for you continued Tushin and you
ought to sign it and ask this gentleman to take it No doubt he
indicating Rostv has connections on the staff You wont find a
better opportunity

Havent I said Im not going to gwovel Denisov interrupted him went
on reading his paper

Rostv had not the courage to persuade Denisov though he instinctively
felt that the way advised by Tushin and the other officers was the
safest and though he would have been glad to be of service to Denisov
He knew his stubborn will and straightforward hasty temper

When the reading of Denisovs virulent reply which took more than an
hour was over Rostv said nothing and he spent the rest of the day in
a most dejected state of mind amid Denisovs hospital comrades who had
gathered round him telling them what he knew and listening to their
stories Denisov was moodily silent all the evening

Late in the evening when Rostv was about to leave he asked Denisov
whether he had no commission for him

Yes wait a bit said Denisov glancing round at the officers and
taking his papers from under his pillow he went to the window where he
had an inkpot and sat down to write

It seems its no use knocking ones head against a wall he said
coming from the window and giving Rostv a large envelope In it was the
petition to the Emperor drawn up by the auditor in which Denisov
without alluding to the offenses of the commissariat officials simply
asked for pardon

Hand it in It seems

He did not finish but gave a painfully unnatural smile





CHAPTER XIX

Having returned to the regiment and told the commander the state of
Denisovs affairs Rostv rode to Tilsit with the letter to the Emperor

On the thirteenth of June the French and Russian Emperors arrived in
Tilsit Bors Drubetsky had asked the important personage on whom he
was in attendance to include him in the suite appointed for the stay at
Tilsit

I should like to see the great man he said alluding to Napoleon
whom hitherto he like everyone else had always called Buonaparte

You are speaking of Buonaparte asked the general smiling

Bors looked at his general inquiringly and immediately saw that he was
being tested

I am speaking Prince of the Emperor Napoleon he replied The
general patted him on the shoulder with a smile

You will go far he said and took him to Tilsit with him

Bors was among the few present at the Niemen on the day the two
Emperors met He saw the raft decorated with monograms saw Napoleon
pass before the French Guards on the farther bank of the river saw the
pensive face of the Emperor Alexander as he sat in silence in a tavern
on the bank of the Niemen awaiting Napoleons arrival saw both Emperors
get into boats and saw how Napoleonreaching the raft firststepped
quickly forward to meet Alexander and held out his hand to him and how
they both retired into the pavilion Since he had begun to move in the
highest circles Bors had made it his habit to watch attentively all
that went on around him and to note it down At the time of the meeting
at Tilsit he asked the names of those who had come with Napoleon and
about the uniforms they wore and listened attentively to words spoken
by important personages At the moment the Emperors went into the
pavilion he looked at his watch and did not forget to look at it again
when Alexander came out The interview had lasted an hour and fifty
three minutes He noted this down that same evening among other facts
he felt to be of historic importance As the Emperors suite was a very
small one it was a matter of great importance for a man who valued his
success in the service to be at Tilsit on the occasion of this
interview between the two Emperors and having succeeded in this Bors
felt that henceforth his position was fully assured He had not only
become known but people had grown accustomed to him and accepted him
Twice he had executed commissions to the Emperor himself so that the
latter knew his face and all those at court far from coldshouldering
him as at first when they considered him a newcomer would now have been
surprised had he been absent

Bors lodged with another adjutant the Polish Count Zhilinski
Zhilinski a Pole brought up in Paris was rich and passionately fond
of the French and almost every day of the stay at Tilsit French
officers of the Guard and from French headquarters were dining and
lunching with him and Bors

On the evening of the twentyfourth of June Count Zhilinski arranged a
supper for his French friends The guest of honor was an aidedecamp of
Napoleons there were also several French officers of the Guard and a
page of Napoleons a young lad of an old aristocratic French family
That same day Rostv profiting by the darkness to avoid being
recognized in civilian dress came to Tilsit and went to the lodging
occupied by Bors and Zhilinski

Rostv in common with the whole army from which he came was far from
having experienced the change of feeling toward Napoleon and the
Frenchwho from being foes had suddenly become friendsthat had taken
place at headquarters and in Bors In the army Bonaparte and the
French were still regarded with mingled feelings of anger contempt and
fear Only recently talking with one of Platovs Cossack officers
Rostv had argued that if Napoleon were taken prisoner he would be
treated not as a sovereign but as a criminal Quite lately happening
to meet a wounded French colonel on the road Rostv had maintained with
heat that peace was impossible between a legitimate sovereign and the
criminal Bonaparte Rostv was therefore unpleasantly struck by the
presence of French officers in Bors lodging dressed in uniforms he
had been accustomed to see from quite a different point of view from the
outposts of the flank As soon as he noticed a French officer who
thrust his head out of the door that warlike feeling of hostility which
he always experienced at the sight of the enemy suddenly seized him He
stopped at the threshold and asked in Russian whether Drubetsky lived
there Bors hearing a strange voice in the anteroom came out to meet
him An expression of annoyance showed itself for a moment on his face
on first recognizing Rostv

Ah its you Very glad very glad to see you he said however
coming toward him with a smile But Rostv had noticed his first
impulse

Ive come at a bad time I think I should not have come but I have
business he said coldly

No I only wonder how you managed to get away from your regiment Dans
un moment je suis a vous he said answering someone who called him

 In a minute I shall be at your disposal

I see Im intruding Rostv repeated

The look of annoyance had already disappeared from Bors face having
evidently reflected and decided how to act he very quietly took both
Rostvs hands and led him into the next room His eyes looking
serenely and steadily at Rostv seemed to be veiled by something as if
screened by blue spectacles of conventionality So it seemed to Rostv

Oh come now As if you could come at a wrong time said Bors and he
led him into the room where the supper table was laid and introduced him
to his guests explaining that he was not a civilian but an hussar
officer and an old friend of his

Count Zhilinskile Comte N Nle Capitaine S S said he naming his
guests Rostv looked frowningly at the Frenchmen bowed reluctantly
and remained silent

Zhilinski evidently did not receive this new Russian person very
willingly into his circle and did not speak to Rostv Bors did not
appear to notice the constraint the newcomer produced and with the same
pleasant composure and the same veiled look in his eyes with which he
had met Rostv tried to enliven the conversation One of the Frenchmen
with the politeness characteristic of his countrymen addressed the
obstinately taciturn Rostv saying that the latter had probably come to
Tilsit to see the Emperor

No I came on business replied Rostv briefly

Rostv had been out of humor from the moment he noticed the look of
dissatisfaction on Bors face and as always happens to those in a bad
humor it seemed to him that everyone regarded him with aversion and
that he was in everybodys way He really was in their way for he alone
took no part in the conversation which again became general The looks
the visitors cast on him seemed to say And what is he sitting here
for He rose and went up to Bors

Anyhow Im in your way he said in a low tone Come and talk over my
business and Ill go away

Oh no not at all said Bors But if you are tired come and lie
down in my room and have a rest

Yes really

They went into the little room where Bors slept Rostv without
sitting down began at once irritably as if Bors were to blame in
some way telling him about Denisovs affair asking him whether
through his general he could and would intercede with the Emperor on
Denisovs behalf and get Denisovs petition handed in When he and Bors
were alone Rostv felt for the first time that he could not look Bors
in the face without a sense of awkwardness Bors with one leg crossed
over the other and stroking his left hand with the slender fingers of
his right listened to Rostv as a general listens to the report of a
subordinate now looking aside and now gazing straight into Rostvs
eyes with the same veiled look Each time this happened Rostv felt
uncomfortable and cast down his eyes

I have heard of such cases and know that His Majesty is very severe in
such affairs I think it would be best not to bring it before the
Emperor but to apply to the commander of the corps But in general
I think

So you dont want to do anything Well then say so Rostv almost
shouted not looking Bors in the face

Bors smiled

On the contrary I will do what I can Only I thought

At that moment Zhilinskis voice was heard calling Bors

Well then go go go said Rostv and refusing supper and
remaining alone in the little room he walked up and down for a long
time hearing the lighthearted French conversation from the next room





CHAPTER XX

Rostv had come to Tilsit the day least suitable for a petition on
Denisovs behalf He could not himself go to the general in attendance
as he was in mufti and had come to Tilsit without permission to do so
and Bors even had he wished to could not have done so on the
following day On that day June 27 the preliminaries of peace were
signed The Emperors exchanged decorations Alexander received the Cross
of the Legion of Honor and Napoleon the Order of St Andrew of the First
Degree and a dinner had been arranged for the evening given by a
battalion of the French Guards to the Preobrazhensk battalion The
Emperors were to be present at that banquet

Rostv felt so ill at ease and uncomfortable with Bors that when the
latter looked in after supper he pretended to be asleep and early next
morning went away avoiding Bors In his civilian clothes and a round
hat he wandered about the town staring at the French and their
uniforms and at the streets and houses where the Russian and French
Emperors were staying In a square he saw tables being set up and
preparations made for the dinner he saw the Russian and French colors
draped from side to side of the streets with huge monograms A and N In
the windows of the houses also flags and bunting were displayed

Bors doesnt want to help me and I dont want to ask him Thats
settled thought Nicholas All is over between us but I wont leave
here without having done all I can for Denisov and certainly not without
getting his letter to the Emperor The Emperor He is here thought
Rostv who had unconsciously returned to the house where Alexander
lodged

Saddled horses were standing before the house and the suite were
assembling evidently preparing for the Emperor to come out

I may see him at any moment thought Rostv If only I were to hand
the letter direct to him and tell him all could they really arrest me
for my civilian clothes Surely not He would understand on whose side
justice lies He understands everything knows everything Who can be
more just more magnanimous than he And even if they did arrest me for
being here what would it matter thought he looking at an officer who
was entering the house the Emperor occupied After all people do go
in Its all nonsense Ill go in and hand the letter to the Emperor
myself so much the worse for Drubetsky who drives me to it And
suddenly with a determination he himself did not expect Rostv felt for
the letter in his pocket and went straight to the house

No I wont miss my opportunity now as I did after Austerlitz he
thought expecting every moment to meet the monarch and conscious of
the blood that rushed to his heart at the thought I will fall at his
feet and beseech him He will lift me up will listen and will even
thank me I am happy when I can do good but to remedy injustice is the
greatest happiness Rostv fancied the sovereign saying And passing
people who looked after him with curiosity he entered the porch of the
Emperors house

A broad staircase led straight up from the entry and to the right he
saw a closed door Below under the staircase was a door leading to the
lower floor

Whom do you want someone inquired

To hand in a letter a petition to His Majesty said Nicholas with a
tremor in his voice

A petition This way to the officer on duty he was shown the door
leading downstairs only it wont be accepted

On hearing this indifferent voice Rostv grew frightened at what he was
doing the thought of meeting the Emperor at any moment was so
fascinating and consequently so alarming that he was ready to run away
but the official who had questioned him opened the door and Rostv
entered

A short stout man of about thirty in white breeches and high boots and
a batiste shirt that he had evidently only just put on standing in that
room and his valet was buttoning on to the back of his breeches a new
pair of handsome silkembroidered braces that for some reason
attracted Rostvs attention This man was speaking to someone in the
adjoining room

A good figure and in her first bloom he was saying but on seeing
Rostv he stopped short and frowned

What is it A petition

What is it asked the person in the other room

Another petitioner answered the man with the braces

Tell him to come later Hell be coming out directly we must go

Later later Tomorrow Its too late

Rostv turned and was about to go but the man in the braces stopped
him

Whom have you come from Who are you

I come from Major Denisov answered Rostv

Are you an officer

Lieutenant Count Rostv

What audacity Hand it in through your commander And go along with
you go and he continued to put on the uniform the valet handed him

Rostv went back into the hall and noticed that in the porch there were
many officers and generals in full parade uniform whom he had to pass

Cursing his temerity his heart sinking at the thought of finding
himself at any moment face to face with the Emperor and being put to
shame and arrested in his presence fully alive now to the impropriety
of his conduct and repenting of it Rostv with downcast eyes was
making his way out of the house through the brilliant suite when a
familiar voice called him and a hand detained him

What are you doing here sir in civilian dress asked a deep voice

It was a cavalry general who had obtained the Emperors special favor
during this campaign and who had formerly commanded the division in
which Rostv was serving

Rostv in dismay began justifying himself but seeing the kindly
jocular face of the general he took him aside and in an excited voice
told him the whole affair asking him to intercede for Denisov whom the
general knew Having heard Rostv to the end the general shook his head
gravely

Im sorry sorry for that fine fellow Give me the letter

Hardly had Rostv handed him the letter and finished explaining
Denisovs case when hasty steps and the jingling of spurs were heard on
the stairs and the general leaving him went to the porch The
gentlemen of the Emperors suite ran down the stairs and went to their
horses Hayne the same groom who had been at Austerlitz led up the
Emperors horse and the faint creak of a footstep Rostv knew at once
was heard on the stairs Forgetting the danger of being recognized
Rostv went close to the porch together with some inquisitive
civilians and again after two years saw those features he adored
that same face and same look and step and the same union of majesty and
mildness And the feeling of enthusiasm and love for his sovereign
rose again in Rostvs soul in all its old force In the uniform of the
Preobrazhensk regimentwhite chamoisleather breeches and high bootsand
wearing a star Rostv did not know it was that of the Legion
dhonneur the monarch came out into the porch putting on his gloves
and carrying his hat under his arm He stopped and looked about him
brightening everything around by his glance He spoke a few words to
some of the generals and recognizing the former commander of Rostvs
division smiled and beckoned to him

All the suite drew back and Rostv saw the general talking for some time
to the Emperor

The Emperor said a few words to him and took a step toward his horse
Again the crowd of members of the suite and street gazers among whom
was Rostv moved nearer to the Emperor Stopping beside his horse with
his hand on the saddle the Emperor turned to the cavalry general and
said in a loud voice evidently wishing to be heard by all

I cannot do it General I cannot because the law is stronger than I
and he raised his foot to the stirrup

The general bowed his head respectfully and the monarch mounted and
rode down the street at a gallop Beside himself with enthusiasm Rostv
ran after him with the crowd





CHAPTER XXI

The Emperor rode to the square where facing one another a battalion of
the Preobrazhensk regiment stood on the right and a battalion of the
French Guards in their bearskin caps on the left

As the Tsar rode up to one flank of the battalions which presented
arms another group of horsemen galloped up to the opposite flank and
at the head of them Rostv recognized Napoleon It could be no one else
He came at a gallop wearing a small hat a blue uniform open over a
white vest and the St Andrew ribbon over his shoulder He was riding a
very fine thoroughbred gray Arab horse with a crimson goldembroidered
saddlecloth On approaching Alexander he raised his hat and as he did
so Rostv with his cavalrymans eye could not help noticing that
Napoleon did not sit well or firmly in the saddle The battalions
shouted Hurrah and Vive lEmpereur Napoleon said something to
Alexander and both Emperors dismounted and took each others hands
Napoleons face wore an unpleasant and artificial smile Alexander was
saying something affable to him

In spite of the trampling of the French gendarmes horses which were
pushing back the crowd Rostv kept his eyes on every movement of
Alexander and Bonaparte It struck him as a surprise that Alexander
treated Bonaparte as an equal and that the latter was quite at ease with
the Tsar as if such relations with an Emperor were an everyday matter
to him

Alexander and Napoleon with the long train of their suites approached
the right flank of the Preobrazhensk battalion and came straight up to
the crowd standing there The crowd unexpectedly found itself so close
to the Emperors that Rostv standing in the front row was afraid he
might be recognized

Sire I ask your permission to present the Legion of Honor to the
bravest of your soldiers said a sharp precise voice articulating
every letter

This was said by the undersized Napoleon looking up straight into
Alexanders eyes Alexander listened attentively to what was said to him
and bending his head smiled pleasantly

To him who has borne himself most bravely in this last war added
Napoleon accentuating each syllable as with a composure and assurance
exasperating to Rostv he ran his eyes over the Russian ranks drawn up
before him who all presented arms with their eyes fixed on their
Emperor

Will Your Majesty allow me to consult the colonel said Alexander and
took a few hasty steps toward Prince Kozlovski the commander of the
battalion

Bonaparte meanwhile began taking the glove off his small white hand
tore it in doing so and threw it away An aidedecamp behind him
rushed forward and picked it up

To whom shall it be given the Emperor Alexander asked Koslovski in
Russian in a low voice

To whomever Your Majesty commands

The Emperor knit his brows with dissatisfaction and glancing back
remarked

But we must give him an answer

Kozlovski scanned the ranks resolutely and included Rostv in his
scrutiny

Can it be me thought Rostv

Lazarev the colonel called with a frown and Lazarev the first
soldier in the rank stepped briskly forward

Where are you off to Stop here voices whispered to Lazarev who did
not know where to go Lazarev stopped casting a sidelong look at his
colonel in alarm His face twitched as often happens to soldiers called
before the ranks

Napoleon slightly turned his head and put his plump little hand out
behind him as if to take something The members of his suite guessing
at once what he wanted moved about and whispered as they passed
something from one to another and a pagethe same one Rostv had seen
the previous evening at Borsran forward and bowing respectfully over
the outstretched hand and not keeping it waiting a moment laid in it an
Order on a red ribbon Napoleon without looking pressed two fingers
together and the badge was between them Then he approached Lazarev who
rolled his eyes and persistently gazed at his own monarch looked round
at the Emperor Alexander to imply that what he was now doing was done
for the sake of his ally and the small white hand holding the Order
touched one of Lazarevs buttons It was as if Napoleon knew that it was
only necessary for his hand to deign to touch that soldiers breast for
the soldier to be forever happy rewarded and distinguished from
everyone else in the world Napoleon merely laid the cross on Lazarevs
breast and dropping his hand turned toward Alexander as though sure
that the cross would adhere there And it really did

Officious hands Russian and French immediately seized the cross and
fastened it to the uniform Lazarev glanced morosely at the little man
with white hands who was doing something to him and still standing
motionless presenting arms looked again straight into Alexanders eyes
as if asking whether he should stand there or go away or do something
else But receiving no orders he remained for some time in that rigid
position

The Emperors remounted and rode away The Preobrazhensk battalion
breaking rank mingled with the French Guards and sat down at the tables
prepared for them

Lazarev sat in the place of honor Russian and French officers embraced
him congratulated him and pressed his hands Crowds of officers and
civilians drew near merely to see him A rumble of Russian and French
voices and laughter filled the air round the tables in the square Two
officers with flushed faces looking cheerful and happy passed by
Rostv

What dyou think of the treat All on silver plate one of them was
saying Have you seen Lazarev

I have

Tomorrow I hear the Preobrazhenskis will give them a dinner

Yes but what luck for Lazarev Twelve hundred francs pension for
life

Heres a cap lads shouted a Preobrazhensk soldier donning a shaggy
French cap

Its a fine thing Firstrate

Have you heard the password asked one Guards officer of another
The day before yesterday it was Napoleon France bravoure
yesterday Alexandre Russie grandeur One day our Emperor gives it
and next day Napoleon Tomorrow our Emperor will send a St Georges
Cross to the bravest of the French Guards It has to be done He must
respond in kind

Bors too with his friend Zhilinski came to see the Preobrazhensk
banquet On his way back he noticed Rostv standing by the corner of a
house

Rostv How dyou do We missed one another he said and could not
refrain from asking what was the matter so strangely dismal and
troubled was Rostvs face

Nothing nothing replied Rostv

Youll call round

Yes I will

Rostv stood at that corner for a long time watching the feast from a
distance In his mind a painful process was going on which he could not
bring to a conclusion Terrible doubts rose in his soul Now he
remembered Denisov with his changed expression his submission and the
whole hospital with arms and legs torn off and its dirt and disease So
vividly did he recall that hospital stench of dead flesh that he looked
round to see where the smell came from Next he thought of that self
satisfied Bonaparte with his small white hand who was now an Emperor
liked and respected by Alexander Then why those severed arms and legs
and those dead men Then again he thought of Lazarev rewarded and
Denisov punished and unpardoned He caught himself harboring such
strange thoughts that he was frightened

The smell of the food the Preobrazhenskis were eating and a sense of
hunger recalled him from these reflections he had to get something to
eat before going away He went to a hotel he had noticed that morning
There he found so many people among them officers who like himself
had come in civilian clothes that he had difficulty in getting a
dinner Two officers of his own division joined him The conversation
naturally turned on the peace The officers his comrades like most of
the army were dissatisfied with the peace concluded after the battle of
Friedland They said that had we held out a little longer Napoleon would
have been done for as his troops had neither provisions nor ammunition
Nicholas ate and drank chiefly the latter in silence He finished a
couple of bottles of wine by himself The process in his mind went on
tormenting him without reaching a conclusion He feared to give way to
his thoughts yet could not get rid of them Suddenly on one of the
officers saying that it was humiliating to look at the French Rostv
began shouting with uncalledfor wrath and therefore much to the
surprise of the officers

How can you judge whats best he cried the blood suddenly rushing to
his face How can you judge the Emperors actions What right have we
to argue We cannot comprehend either the Emperors aims or his
actions

But I never said a word about the Emperor said the officer
justifying himself and unable to understand Rostvs outburst except
on the supposition that he was drunk

But Rostv did not listen to him

We are not diplomatic officials we are soldiers and nothing more he
went on If we are ordered to die we must die If were punished it
means that we have deserved it its not for us to judge If the Emperor
pleases to recognize Bonaparte as Emperor and to conclude an alliance
with him it means that that is the right thing to do If once we begin
judging and arguing about everything nothing sacred will be left That
way we shall be saying there is no Godnothing shouted Nicholas
banging the tablevery little to the point as it seemed to his
listeners but quite relevantly to the course of his own thoughts

Our business is to do our duty to fight and not to think Thats
all said he

And to drink said one of the officers not wishing to quarrel

Yes and to drink assented Nicholas Hullo there Another bottle
he shouted

In 1808 the Emperor Alexander went to Erfurt for a fresh interview with
the Emperor Napoleon and in the upper circles of Petersburg there was
much talk of the grandeur of this important meeting





CHAPTER XXII

In 1809 the intimacy between the worlds two arbiters as Napoleon and
Alexander were called was such that when Napoleon declared war on
Austria a Russian corps crossed the frontier to cooperate with our old
enemy Bonaparte against our old ally the Emperor of Austria and in
court circles the possibility of marriage between Napoleon and one of
Alexanders sisters was spoken of But besides considerations of foreign
policy the attention of Russian society was at that time keenly
directed on the internal changes that were being undertaken in all the
departments of government

Life meanwhilereal life with its essential interests of health and
sickness toil and rest and its intellectual interests in thought
science poetry music love friendship hatred and passionswent on
as usual independently of and apart from political friendship or enmity
with Napoleon Bonaparte and from all the schemes of reconstruction





BOOK SIX 1808 10





CHAPTER I

Prince Andrew had spent two years continuously in the country

All the plans Pierre had attempted on his estatesand constantly
changing from one thing to another had never accomplishedwere carried
out by Prince Andrew without display and without perceptible difficulty

He had in the highest degree a practical tenacity which Pierre lacked
and without fuss or strain on his part this set things going

On one of his estates the three hundred serfs were liberated and became
free agricultural laborersthis being one of the first examples of the
kind in Russia On other estates the serfs compulsory labor was
commuted for a quitrent A trained midwife was engaged for Bogucharovo
at his expense and a priest was paid to teach reading and writing to
the children of the peasants and household serfs

Prince Andrew spent half his time at Bald Hills with his father and his
son who was still in the care of nurses The other half he spent in
Bogucharovo Cloister as his father called Prince Andrews estate
Despite the indifference to the affairs of the world he had expressed to
Pierre he diligently followed all that went on received many books
and to his surprise noticed that when he or his father had visitors from
Petersburg the very vortex of life these people lagged behind
himselfwho never left the countryin knowledge of what was happening in
home and foreign affairs

Besides being occupied with his estates and reading a great variety of
books Prince Andrew was at this time busy with a critical survey of our
last two unfortunate campaigns and with drawing up a proposal for a
reform of the army rules and regulations

In the spring of 1809 he went to visit the Ryazan estates which had been
inherited by his son whose guardian he was

Warmed by the spring sunshine he sat in the calche looking at the new
grass the first leaves on the birches and the first puffs of white
spring clouds floating across the clear blue sky He was not thinking of
anything but looked absentmindedly and cheerfully from side to side

They crossed the ferry where he had talked with Pierre the year before
They went through the muddy village past threshing floors and green
fields of winter rye downhill where snow still lodged near the bridge
uphill where the clay had been liquefied by the rain past strips of
stubble land and bushes touched with green here and there and into a
birch forest growing on both sides of the road In the forest it was
almost hot no wind could be felt The birches with their sticky green
leaves were motionless and lilaccolored flowers and the first blades
of green grass were pushing up and lifting last years leaves The
coarse evergreen color of the small fir trees scattered here and there
among the birches was an unpleasant reminder of winter On entering the
forest the horses began to snort and sweated visibly

Peter the footman made some remark to the coachman the latter assented
But apparently the coachmans sympathy was not enough for Peter and he
turned on the box toward his master

How pleasant it is your excellency he said with a respectful smile

What

Its pleasant your excellency

What is he talking about thought Prince Andrew Oh the spring I
suppose he thought as he turned round Yes really everything is
green already How early The birches and cherry and alders too are
coming out But the oaks show no sign yet Ah here is one oak

At the edge of the road stood an oak Probably ten times the age of the
birches that formed the forest it was ten times as thick and twice as
tall as they It was an enormous tree its girth twice as great as a man
could embrace and evidently long ago some of its branches had been
broken off and its bark scarred With its huge ungainly limbs sprawling
unsymmetrically and its gnarled hands and fingers it stood an aged
stern and scornful monster among the smiling birch trees Only the
deadlooking evergreen firs dotted about in the forest and this oak
refused to yield to the charm of spring or notice either the spring or
the sunshine

Spring love happiness this oak seemed to say Are you not weary of
that stupid meaningless constantly repeated fraud Always the same and
always a fraud There is no spring no sun no happiness Look at those
cramped dead firs ever the same and at me too sticking out my broken
and barked fingers just where they have grown whether from my back or
my sides as they have grown so I stand and I do not believe in your
hopes and your lies

As he passed through the forest Prince Andrew turned several times to
look at that oak as if expecting something from it Under the oak too
were flowers and grass but it stood among them scowling rigid
misshapen and grim as ever

Yes the oak is right a thousand times right thought Prince Andrew
Let othersthe youngyield afresh to that fraud but we know life our
life is finished

A whole sequence of new thoughts hopeless but mournfully pleasant rose
in his soul in connection with that tree During this journey he as it
were considered his life afresh and arrived at his old conclusion
restful in its hopelessness that it was not for him to begin anything
anewbut that he must live out his life content to do no harm and not
disturbing himself or desiring anything





CHAPTER II

Prince Andrew had to see the Marshal of the Nobility for the district in
connection with the affairs of the Ryazan estate of which he was
trustee This Marshal was Count Ily Rostv and in the middle of May
Prince Andrew went to visit him

It was now hot spring weather The whole forest was already clothed in
green It was dusty and so hot that on passing near water one longed to
bathe

Prince Andrew depressed and preoccupied with the business about which
he had to speak to the Marshal was driving up the avenue in the grounds
of the Rostvs house at Otradnoe He heard merry girlish cries behind
some trees on the right and saw a group of girls running to cross the
path of his calche Ahead of the rest and nearer to him ran a dark
haired remarkably slim pretty girl in a yellow chintz dress with a
white handkerchief on her head from under which loose locks of hair
escaped The girl was shouting something but seeing that he was a
stranger ran back laughing without looking at him

Suddenly he did not know why he felt a pang The day was so beautiful
the sun so bright everything around so gay but that slim pretty girl
did not know or wish to know of his existence and was contented and
cheerful in her own separateprobably foolishbut bright and happy life
What is she so glad about What is she thinking of Not of the military
regulations or of the arrangement of the Ryazan serfs quitrents Of
what is she thinking Why is she so happy Prince Andrew asked himself
with instinctive curiosity

In 1809 Count Ily Rostv was living at Otradnoe just as he had done in
former years that is entertaining almost the whole province with
hunts theatricals dinners and music He was glad to see Prince
Andrew as he was to see any new visitor and insisted on his staying
the night

During the dull day in the course of which he was entertained by his
elderly hosts and by the more important of the visitors the old counts
house was crowded on account of an approaching name day Prince Andrew
repeatedly glanced at Natsha gay and laughing among the younger
members of the company and asked himself each time What is she
thinking about Why is she so glad

That night alone in new surroundings he was long unable to sleep He
read awhile and then put out his candle but relit it It was hot in the
room the inside shutters of which were closed He was cross with the
stupid old man as he called Rostv who had made him stay by assuring
him that some necessary documents had not yet arrived from town and he
was vexed with himself for having stayed

He got up and went to the window to open it As soon as he opened the
shutters the moonlight as if it had long been watching for this burst
into the room He opened the casement The night was fresh bright and
very still Just before the window was a row of pollard trees looking
black on one side and with a silvery light on the other Beneath the
trees grew some kind of lush wet bushy vegetation with silverlit
leaves and stems here and there Farther back beyond the dark trees a
roof glittered with dew to the right was a leafy tree with brilliantly
white trunk and branches and above it shone the moon nearly at its
full in a pale almost starless spring sky Prince Andrew leaned his
elbows on the window ledge and his eyes rested on that sky

His room was on the first floor Those in the rooms above were also
awake He heard female voices overhead

Just once more said a girlish voice above him which Prince Andrew
recognized at once

But when are you coming to bed replied another voice

I wont I cant sleep whats the use Come now for the last time

Two girlish voices sang a musical passagethe end of some song

Oh how lovely Now go to sleep and theres an end of it

You go to sleep but I cant said the first voice coming nearer to
the window She was evidently leaning right out for the rustle of her
dress and even her breathing could be heard Everything was stonestill
like the moon and its light and the shadows Prince Andrew too dared
not stir for fear of betraying his unintentional presence

Snya Snya he again heard the first speaker Oh how can you
sleep Only look how glorious it is Ah how glorious Do wake up
Snya she said almost with tears in her voice There never never was
such a lovely night before

Snya made some reluctant reply

Do just come and see what a moon Oh how lovely Come here
Darling sweetheart come here There you see I feel like sitting down
on my heels putting my arms round my knees like this straining tight
as tight as possible and flying away Like this

Take care youll fall out

He heard the sound of a scuffle and Snyas disapproving voice Its
past one oclock

Oh you only spoil things for me All right go go

Again all was silent but Prince Andrew knew she was still sitting
there From time to time he heard a soft rustle and at times a sigh

O God O God What does it mean she suddenly exclaimed To bed then
if it must be and she slammed the casement

For her I might as well not exist thought Prince Andrew while he
listened to her voice for some reason expecting yet fearing that she
might say something about him There she is again As if it were on
purpose thought he

In his soul there suddenly arose such an unexpected turmoil of youthful
thoughts and hopes contrary to the whole tenor of his life that unable
to explain his condition to himself he lay down and fell asleep at once





CHAPTER III

Next morning having taken leave of no one but the count and not
waiting for the ladies to appear Prince Andrew set off for home

It was already the beginning of June when on his return journey he drove
into the birch forest where the gnarled old oak had made so strange and
memorable an impression on him In the forest the harness bells sounded
yet more muffled than they had done six weeks before for now all was
thick shady and dense and the young firs dotted about in the forest
did not jar on the general beauty but lending themselves to the mood
around were delicately green with fluffy young shoots

The whole day had been hot Somewhere a storm was gathering but only a
small cloud had scattered some raindrops lightly sprinkling the road
and the sappy leaves The left side of the forest was dark in the shade
the right side glittered in the sunlight wet and shiny and scarcely
swayed by the breeze Everything was in blossom the nightingales
trilled and their voices reverberated now near now far away

Yes here in this forest was that oak with which I agreed thought
Prince Andrew But where is it he again wondered gazing at the left
side of the road and without recognizing it he looked with admiration
at the very oak he sought The old oak quite transfigured spreading
out a canopy of sappy darkgreen foliage stood rapt and slightly
trembling in the rays of the evening sun Neither gnarled fingers nor
old scars nor old doubts and sorrows were any of them in evidence now
Through the hard centuryold bark even where there were no twigs
leaves had sprouted such as one could hardly believe the old veteran
could have produced

Yes it is the same oak thought Prince Andrew and all at once he was
seized by an unreasoning springtime feeling of joy and renewal All the
best moments of his life suddenly rose to his memory Austerlitz with
the lofty heavens his wifes dead reproachful face Pierre at the
ferry that girl thrilled by the beauty of the night and that night
itself and the moon and all this rushed suddenly to his mind

No life is not over at thirtyone Prince Andrew suddenly decided
finally and decisively It is not enough for me to know what I have in
meeveryone must know it Pierre and that young girl who wanted to fly
away into the sky everyone must know me so that my life may not be
lived for myself alone while others live so apart from it but so that
it may be reflected in them all and they and I may live in harmony

On reaching home Prince Andrew decided to go to Petersburg that autumn
and found all sorts of reasons for this decision A whole series of
sensible and logical considerations showing it to be essential for him
to go to Petersburg and even to reenter the service kept springing up
in his mind He could not now understand how he could ever even have
doubted the necessity of taking an active share in life just as a month
before he had not understood how the idea of leaving the quiet country
could ever enter his head It now seemed clear to him that all his
experience of life must be senselessly wasted unless he applied it to
some kind of work and again played an active part in life He did not
even remember how formerly on the strength of similar wretched logical
arguments it had seemed obvious that he would be degrading himself if
he now after the lessons he had had in life allowed himself to believe
in the possibility of being useful and in the possibility of happiness
or love Now reason suggested quite the opposite After that journey to
Ryazan he found the country dull his former pursuits no longer
interested him and often when sitting alone in his study he got up
went to the mirror and gazed a long time at his own face Then he would
turn away to the portrait of his dead Lise who with hair curled a la
grecque looked tenderly and gaily at him out of the gilt frame She did
not now say those former terrible words to him but looked simply
merrily and inquisitively at him And Prince Andrew crossing his arms
behind him long paced the room now frowning now smiling as he
reflected on those irrational inexpressible thoughts secret as a
crime which altered his whole life and were connected with Pierre with
fame with the girl at the window the oak and womans beauty and love
And if anyone came into his room at such moments he was particularly
cold stern and above all unpleasantly logical

My dear Princess Mary entering at such a moment would say little
Nicholas cant go out today its very cold

If it were hot Prince Andrew would reply at such times very dryly to
his sister he could go out in his smock but as it is cold he must
wear warm clothes which were designed for that purpose That is what
follows from the fact that it is cold and not that a child who needs
fresh air should remain at home he would add with extreme logic as if
punishing someone for those secret illogical emotions that stirred
within him

At such moments Princess Mary would think how intellectual work dries
men up





CHAPTER IV

Prince Andrew arrived in Petersburg in August 1809 It was the time
when the youthful Speranski was at the zenith of his fame and his
reforms were being pushed forward with the greatest energy That same
August the Emperor was thrown from his calche injured his leg and
remained three weeks at Peterhof receiving Speranski every day and no
one else At that time the two famous decrees were being prepared that
so agitated societyabolishing court ranks and introducing examinations
to qualify for the grades of Collegiate Assessor and State Councilorand
not merely these but a whole state constitution intended to change the
existing order of government in Russia legal administrative and
financial from the Council of State down to the district tribunals Now
those vague liberal dreams with which the Emperor Alexander had ascended
the throne and which he had tried to put into effect with the aid of
his associates Czartoryski Novosltsev Kochubey and Strogonovwhom
he himself in jest had called his Comite de salut publicwere taking
shape and being realized

Now all these men were replaced by Speranski on the civil side and
Arakcheev on the military Soon after his arrival Prince Andrew as a
gentleman of the chamber presented himself at court and at a levee The
Emperor though he met him twice did not favor him with a single word
It had always seemed to Prince Andrew before that he was antipathetic to
the Emperor and that the latter disliked his face and personality
generally and in the cold repellent glance the Emperor gave him he
now found further confirmation of this surmise The courtiers explained
the Emperors neglect of him by His Majestys displeasure at Bolknskis
not having served since 1805

I know myself that one cannot help ones sympathies and antipathies
thought Prince Andrew so it will not do to present my proposal for the
reform of the army regulations to the Emperor personally but the
project will speak for itself

He mentioned what he had written to an old field marshal a friend of
his fathers The field marshal made an appointment to see him received
him graciously and promised to inform the Emperor A few days later
Prince Andrew received notice that he was to go to see the Minister of
War Count Arakcheev

On the appointed day Prince Andrew entered Count Arakcheevs waiting
room at nine in the morning

He did not know Arakcheev personally had never seen him and all he had
heard of him inspired him with but little respect for the man

He is Minister of War a man trusted by the Emperor and I need not
concern myself about his personal qualities he has been commissioned to
consider my project so he alone can get it adopted thought Prince
Andrew as he waited among a number of important and unimportant people
in Count Arakcheevs waiting room

During his service chiefly as an adjutant Prince Andrew had seen the
anterooms of many important men and the different types of such rooms
were well known to him Count Arakcheevs anteroom had quite a special
character The faces of the unimportant people awaiting their turn for
an audience showed embarrassment and servility the faces of those of
higher rank expressed a common feeling of awkwardness covered by a mask
of unconcern and ridicule of themselves their situation and the person
for whom they were waiting Some walked thoughtfully up and down others
whispered and laughed Prince Andrew heard the nickname Sila
Andrevich and the words Uncle will give it to us hot in reference
to Count Arakcheev One general an important personage evidently
feeling offended at having to wait so long sat crossing and uncrossing
his legs and smiling contemptuously to himself

But the moment the door opened one feeling alone appeared on all
facesthat of fear Prince Andrew for the second time asked the adjutant
on duty to take in his name but received an ironical look and was told
that his turn would come in due course After some others had been shown
in and out of the ministers room by the adjutant on duty an officer
who struck Prince Andrew by his humiliated and frightened air was
admitted at that terrible door This officers audience lasted a long
time Then suddenly the grating sound of a harsh voice was heard from
the other side of the door and the officerwith pale face and trembling
lipscame out and passed through the waiting room clutching his head

After this Prince Andrew was conducted to the door and the officer on
duty said in a whisper To the right at the window

Prince Andrew entered a plain tidy room and saw at the table a man of
forty with a long waist a long closely cropped head deep wrinkles
scowling brows above dull greenishhazel eyes and an overhanging red
nose Arakcheev turned his head toward him without looking at him

What is your petition asked Arakcheev

I am not petitioning your excellency returned Prince Andrew quietly

Arakcheevs eyes turned toward him

Sit down said he Prince Bolknski

I am not petitioning about anything His Majesty the Emperor has
deigned to send your excellency a project submitted by me

You see my dear sir I have read your project interrupted Arakcheev
uttering only the first words amiably and thenagain without looking at
Prince Andrewrelapsing gradually into a tone of grumbling contempt
You are proposing new military laws There are many laws but no one to
carry out the old ones Nowadays everybody designs laws it is easier
writing than doing

I came at His Majesty the Emperors wish to learn from your excellency
how you propose to deal with the memorandum I have presented said
Prince Andrew politely

I have endorsed a resolution on your memorandum and sent it to the
committee I do not approve of it said Arakcheev rising and taking a
paper from his writing table Here and he handed it to Prince Andrew

Across the paper was scrawled in pencil without capital letters
misspelled and without punctuation Unsoundly constructed because
resembles an imitation of the French military code and from the Articles
of War needlessly deviating

To what committee has the memorandum been referred inquired Prince
Andrew

To the Committee on Army Regulations and I have recommended that your
honor should be appointed a member but without a salary

Prince Andrew smiled

I dont want one

A member without salary repeated Arakcheev I have the honor Eh
Call the next one Who else is there he shouted bowing to Prince
Andrew





CHAPTER V

While waiting for the announcement of his appointment to the committee
Prince Andrew looked up his former acquaintances particularly those he
knew to be in power and whose aid he might need In Petersburg he now
experienced the same feeling he had had on the eve of a battle when
troubled by anxious curiosity and irresistibly attracted to the ruling
circles where the future on which the fate of millions depended was
being shaped From the irritation of the older men the curiosity of the
uninitiated the reserve of the initiated the hurry and preoccupation
of everyone and the innumerable committees and commissions of whose
existence he learned every day he felt that now in 1809 here in
Petersburg a vast civil conflict was in preparation the commander in
chief of which was a mysterious person he did not know but who was
supposed to be a man of geniusSperanski And this movement of
reconstruction of which Prince Andrew had a vague idea and Speranski
its chief promoter began to interest him so keenly that the question of
the army regulations quickly receded to a secondary place in his
consciousness

Prince Andrew was most favorably placed to secure good reception in the
highest and most diverse Petersburg circles of the day The reforming
party cordially welcomed and courted him in the first place because he
was reputed to be clever and very well read and secondly because by
liberating his serfs he had obtained the reputation of being a liberal
The party of the old and dissatisfied who censured the innovations
turned to him expecting his sympathy in their disapproval of the
reforms simply because he was the son of his father The feminine
society world welcomed him gladly because he was rich distinguished a
good match and almost a newcomer with a halo of romance on account of
his supposed death and the tragic loss of his wife Besides this the
general opinion of all who had known him previously was that he had
greatly improved during these last five years having softened and grown
more manly lost his former affectation pride and contemptuous irony
and acquired the serenity that comes with years People talked about
him were interested in him and wanted to meet him

The day after his interview with Count Arakcheev Prince Andrew spent
the evening at Count Kochubeys He told the count of his interview with
Sila Andrevich Kochubey spoke of Arakcheev by that nickname with the
same vague irony Prince Andrew had noticed in the Minister of Wars
anteroom

Mon cher even in this case you cant do without Michael Mikhaylovich
Speranski He manages everything Ill speak to him He has promised to
come this evening

What has Speranski to do with the army regulations asked Prince
Andrew

Kochubey shook his head smilingly as if surprised at Bolknskis
simplicity

We were talking to him about you a few days ago Kochubey continued
and about your freed plowmen

Oh is it you Prince who have freed your serfs said an old man of
Catherines day turning contemptuously toward Bolknski

It was a small estate that brought in no profit replied Prince
Andrew trying to extenuate his action so as not to irritate the old man
uselessly

Afraid of being late said the old man looking at Kochubey

Theres one thing I dont understand he continued Who will plow the
land if they are set free It is easy to write laws but difficult to
rule Just the same as nowI ask you Countwho will be heads of the
departments when everybody has to pass examinations

Those who pass the examinations I suppose replied Kochubey crossing
his legs and glancing round

Well I have Pryanichnikov serving under me a splendid man a
priceless man but hes sixty Is he to go up for examination

Yes thats a difficulty as education is not at all general but

Count Kochubey did not finish He rose took Prince Andrew by the arm
and went to meet a tall bald fair man of about forty with a large open
forehead and a long face of unusual and peculiar whiteness who was just
entering The newcomer wore a blue swallowtail coat with a cross
suspended from his neck and a star on his left breast It was Speranski
Prince Andrew recognized him at once and felt a throb within him as
happens at critical moments of life Whether it was from respect envy
or anticipation he did not know Speranskis whole figure was of a
peculiar type that made him easily recognizable In the society in which
Prince Andrew lived he had never seen anyone who together with awkward
and clumsy gestures possessed such calmness and selfassurance he had
never seen so resolute yet gentle an expression as that in those half
closed rather humid eyes or so firm a smile that expressed nothing
nor had he heard such a refined smooth soft voice above all he had
never seen such delicate whiteness of face or handshands which were
broad but very plump soft and white Such whiteness and softness
Prince Andrew had only seen on the faces of soldiers who had been long
in hospital This was Speranski Secretary of State reporter to the
Emperor and his companion at Erfurt where he had more than once met and
talked with Napoleon

Speranski did not shift his eyes from one face to another as people
involuntarily do on entering a large company and was in no hurry to
speak He spoke slowly with assurance that he would be listened to and
he looked only at the person with whom he was conversing

Prince Andrew followed Speranskis every word and movement with
particular attention As happens to some people especially to men who
judge those near to them severely he always on meeting anyone
newespecially anyone whom like Speranski he knew by
reputationexpected to discover in him the perfection of human
qualities

Speranski told Kochubey he was sorry he had been unable to come sooner
as he had been detained at the palace He did not say that the Emperor
had kept him and Prince Andrew noticed this affectation of modesty
When Kochubey introduced Prince Andrew Speranski slowly turned his eyes
to Bolknski with his customary smile and looked at him in silence

I am very glad to make your acquaintance I had heard of you as
everyone has he said after a pause

Kochubey said a few words about the reception Arakcheev had given
Bolknski Speranski smiled more markedly

The chairman of the Committee on Army Regulations is my good friend
Monsieur Magnitski he said fully articulating every word and
syllable and if you like I can put you in touch with him He paused
at the full stop I hope you will find him sympathetic and ready to co
operate in promoting all that is reasonable

A circle soon formed round Speranski and the old man who had talked
about his subordinate Pryanichnikov addressed a question to him

Prince Andrew without joining in the conversation watched every movement
of Speranskis this man not long since an insignificant divinity
student who now Bolknski thought held in his handsthose plump white
handsthe fate of Russia Prince Andrew was struck by the
extraordinarily disdainful composure with which Speranski answered the
old man He appeared to address condescending words to him from an
immeasurable height When the old man began to speak too loud Speranski
smiled and said he could not judge of the advantage or disadvantage of
what pleased the sovereign

Having talked for a little while in the general circle Speranski rose
and coming up to Prince Andrew took him along to the other end of the
room It was clear that he thought it necessary to interest himself in
Bolknski

I had no chance to talk with you Prince during the animated
conversation in which that venerable gentleman involved me he said
with a mildly contemptuous smile as if intimating by that smile that he
and Prince Andrew understood the insignificance of the people with whom
he had just been talking This flattered Prince Andrew I have known of
you for a long time first from your action with regard to your serfs a
first example of which it is very desirable that there should be more
imitators and secondly because you are one of those gentlemen of the
chamber who have not considered themselves offended by the new decree
concerning the ranks allotted to courtiers which is causing so much
gossip and tittletattle

No said Prince Andrew my father did not wish me to take advantage
of the privilege I began the service from the lower grade

Your father a man of the last century evidently stands above our
contemporaries who so condemn this measure which merely reestablishes
natural justice

I think however that these condemnations have some ground returned
Prince Andrew trying to resist Speranskis influence of which he began
to be conscious He did not like to agree with him in everything and
felt a wish to contradict Though he usually spoke easily and well he
felt a difficulty in expressing himself now while talking with
Speranski He was too much absorbed in observing the famous mans
personality

Grounds of personal ambition maybe Speranski put in quietly

And of state interest to some extent said Prince Andrew

What do you mean asked Speranski quietly lowering his eyes

I am an admirer of Montesquieu replied Prince Andrew and his idea
that le principe des monarchies est lhonneur me parait incontestable
Certains droits et privileges de la noblesse me paraissent etre des
moyens de soutenir ce sentiment

 The principle of monarchies is honor seems to me incontestable
Certain rights and privileges for the aristocracy appear to me a means
of maintaining that sentiment

The smile vanished from Speranskis white face which was much improved
by the change Probably Prince Andrews thought interested him

Si vous envisagez la question sous ce point de vue he began
pronouncing French with evident difficulty and speaking even slower
than in Russian but quite calmly

 If you regard the question from that point of view

Speranski went on to say that honor lhonneur cannot be upheld by
privileges harmful to the service that honor lhonneur is either a
negative concept of not doing what is blameworthy or it is a source of
emulation in pursuit of commendation and rewards which recognize it
His arguments were concise simple and clear

An institution upholding honor the source of emulation is one similar
to the Legion dhonneur of the great Emperor Napoleon not harmful but
helpful to the success of the service but not a class or court
privilege

I do not dispute that but it cannot be denied that court privileges
have attained the same end returned Prince Andrew Every courtier
considers himself bound to maintain his position worthily

Yet you do not care to avail yourself of the privilege Prince said
Speranski indicating by a smile that he wished to finish amiably an
argument which was embarrassing for his companion If you will do me
the honor of calling on me on Wednesday he added I will after
talking with Magnitski let you know what may interest you and shall
also have the pleasure of a more detailed chat with you

Closing his eyes he bowed a la francaise without taking leave and
trying to attract as little attention as possible he left the room





CHAPTER VI

During the first weeks of his stay in Petersburg Prince Andrew felt the
whole trend of thought he had formed during his life of seclusion quite
overshadowed by the trifling cares that engrossed him in that city

On returning home in the evening he would jot down in his notebook four
or five necessary calls or appointments for certain hours The mechanism
of life the arrangement of the day so as to be in time everywhere
absorbed the greater part of his vital energy He did nothing did not
even think or find time to think but only talked and talked
successfully of what he had thought while in the country

He sometimes noticed with dissatisfaction that he repeated the same
remark on the same day in different circles But he was so busy for
whole days together that he had no time to notice that he was thinking
of nothing

As he had done on their first meeting at Kochubeys Speranski produced
a strong impression on Prince Andrew on the Wednesday when he received
him ttette at his own house and talked to him long and
confidentially

To Bolknski so many people appeared contemptible and insignificant
creatures and he so longed to find in someone the living ideal of that
perfection toward which he strove that he readily believed that in
Speranski he had found this ideal of a perfectly rational and virtuous
man Had Speranski sprung from the same class as himself and possessed
the same breeding and traditions Bolknski would soon have discovered
his weak human unheroic sides but as it was Speranskis strange and
logical turn of mind inspired him with respect all the more because he
did not quite understand him Moreover Speranski either because he
appreciated the others capacity or because he considered it necessary
to win him to his side showed off his dispassionate calm reasonableness
before Prince Andrew and flattered him with that subtle flattery which
goes hand in hand with selfassurance and consists in a tacit assumption
that ones companion is the only man besides oneself capable of
understanding the folly of the rest of mankind and the reasonableness
and profundity of ones own ideas

During their long conversation on Wednesday evening Speranski more than
once remarked We regard everything that is above the common level of
rooted custom or with a smile But we want the wolves to be fed
and the sheep to be safe or They cannot understand this and
all in a way that seemed to say We you and I understand what they
are and who we are

This first long conversation with Speranski only strengthened in Prince
Andrew the feeling he had experienced toward him at their first meeting
He saw in him a remarkable clearthinking man of vast intellect who by
his energy and persistence had attained power which he was using solely
for the welfare of Russia In Prince Andrews eyes Speranski was the man
he would himself have wished to beone who explained all the facts of
life reasonably considered important only what was rational and was
capable of applying the standard of reason to everything Everything
seemed so simple and clear in Speranskis exposition that Prince Andrew
involuntarily agreed with him about everything If he replied and
argued it was only because he wished to maintain his independence and
not submit to Speranskis opinions entirely Everything was right and
everything was as it should be only one thing disconcerted Prince
Andrew This was Speranskis cold mirrorlike look which did not allow
one to penetrate to his soul and his delicate white hands which Prince
Andrew involuntarily watched as one does watch the hands of those who
possess power This mirrorlike gaze and those delicate hands irritated
Prince Andrew he knew not why He was unpleasantly struck too by the
excessive contempt for others that he observed in Speranski and by the
diversity of lines of argument he used to support his opinions He made
use of every kind of mental device except analogy and passed too
boldly it seemed to Prince Andrew from one to another Now he would
take up the position of a practical man and condemn dreamers now that
of a satirist and laugh ironically at his opponents now grow severely
logical or suddenly rise to the realm of metaphysics This last
resource was one he very frequently employed He would transfer a
question to metaphysical heights pass on to definitions of space time
and thought and having deduced the refutation he needed would again
descend to the level of the original discussion

In general the trait of Speranskis mentality which struck Prince Andrew
most was his absolute and unshakable belief in the power and authority
of reason It was evident that the thought could never occur to him
which to Prince Andrew seemed so natural namely that it is after all
impossible to express all one thinks and that he had never felt the
doubt Is not all I think and believe nonsense And it was just this
peculiarity of Speranskis mind that particularly attracted Prince
Andrew

During the first period of their acquaintance Bolknski felt a
passionate admiration for him similar to that which he had once felt for
Bonaparte The fact that Speranski was the son of a village priest and
that stupid people might meanly despise him on account of his humble
origin as in fact many did caused Prince Andrew to cherish his
sentiment for him the more and unconsciously to strengthen it

On that first evening Bolknski spent with him having mentioned the
Commission for the Revision of the Code of Laws Speranski told him
sarcastically that the Commission had existed for a hundred and fifty
years had cost millions and had done nothing except that Rosenkampf
had stuck labels on the corresponding paragraphs of the different codes

And that is all the state has for the millions it has spent said he
We want to give the Senate new juridical powers but we have no laws
That is why it is a sin for men like you Prince not to serve in these
times

Prince Andrew said that for that work an education in jurisprudence was
needed which he did not possess

But nobody possesses it so what would you have It is a vicious circle
from which we must break a way out

A week later Prince Andrew was a member of the Committee on Army
Regulations andwhat he had not at all expectedwas chairman of a
section of the committee for the revision of the laws At Speranskis
request he took the first part of the Civil Code that was being drawn up
and with the aid of the Code Napoleon and the Institutes of Justinian
he worked at formulating the section on Personal Rights





CHAPTER VII

Nearly two years before this in 1808 Pierre on returning to Petersburg
after visiting his estates had involuntarily found himself in a leading
position among the Petersburg Freemasons He arranged dining and funeral
lodge meetings enrolled new members and busied himself uniting various
lodges and acquiring authentic charters He gave money for the erection
of temples and supplemented as far as he could the collection of alms
in regard to which the majority of members were stingy and irregular He
supported almost singlehanded a poorhouse the order had founded in
Petersburg

His life meanwhile continued as before with the same infatuations and
dissipations He liked to dine and drink well and though he considered
it immoral and humiliating could not resist the temptations of the
bachelor circles in which he moved

Amid the turmoil of his activities and distractions however Pierre at
the end of a year began to feel that the more firmly he tried to rest
upon it the more masonic ground on which he stood gave way under him
At the same time he felt that the deeper the ground sank under him the
closer bound he involuntarily became to the order When he had joined
the Freemasons he had experienced the feeling of one who confidently
steps onto the smooth surface of a bog When he put his foot down it
sank in To make quite sure of the firmness of the ground he put his
other foot down and sank deeper still became stuck in it and
involuntarily waded kneedeep in the bog

Joseph Alexeevich was not in Petersburghe had of late stood aside from
the affairs of the Petersburg lodges and lived almost entirely in
Moscow All the members of the lodges were men Pierre knew in ordinary
life and it was difficult for him to regard them merely as Brothers in
Freemasonry and not as Prince B or Ivan Vaslevich D whom he knew in
society mostly as weak and insignificant men Under the masonic aprons
and insignia he saw the uniforms and decorations at which they aimed in
ordinary life Often after collecting alms and reckoning up twenty to
thirty rubles received for the most part in promises from a dozen
members of whom half were as well able to pay as himself Pierre
remembered the masonic vow in which each Brother promised to devote all
his belongings to his neighbor and doubts on which he tried not to
dwell arose in his soul

He divided the Brothers he knew into four categories In the first he
put those who did not take an active part in the affairs of the lodges
or in human affairs but were exclusively occupied with the mystical
science of the order with questions of the threefold designation of
God the three primordial elementssulphur mercury and saltor the
meaning of the square and all the various figures of the temple of
Solomon Pierre respected this class of Brothers to which the elder ones
chiefly belonged including Pierre thought Joseph Alexeevich himself
but he did not share their interests His heart was not in the mystical
aspect of Freemasonry

In the second category Pierre reckoned himself and others like him
seeking and vacillating who had not yet found in Freemasonry a straight
and comprehensible path but hoped to do so

In the third category he included those Brothers the majority who saw
nothing in Freemasonry but the external forms and ceremonies and prized
the strict performance of these forms without troubling about their
purport or significance Such were Willarski and even the Grand Master
of the principal lodge

Finally to the fourth category also a great many Brothers belonged
particularly those who had lately joined These according to Pierres
observations were men who had no belief in anything nor desire for
anything but joined the Freemasons merely to associate with the wealthy
young Brothers who were influential through their connections or rank
and of whom there were very many in the lodge

Pierre began to feel dissatisfied with what he was doing Freemasonry
at any rate as he saw it here sometimes seemed to him based merely on
externals He did not think of doubting Freemasonry itself but
suspected that Russian Masonry had taken a wrong path and deviated from
its original principles And so toward the end of the year he went
abroad to be initiated into the higher secrets of the order

In the summer of 1809 Pierre returned to Petersburg Our Freemasons knew
from correspondence with those abroad that Bezkhov had obtained the
confidence of many highly placed persons had been initiated into many
mysteries had been raised to a higher grade and was bringing back with
him much that might conduce to the advantage of the masonic cause in
Russia The Petersburg Freemasons all came to see him tried to
ingratiate themselves with him and it seemed to them all that he was
preparing something for them and concealing it

A solemn meeting of the lodge of the second degree was convened at
which Pierre promised to communicate to the Petersburg Brothers what he
had to deliver to them from the highest leaders of their order The
meeting was a full one After the usual ceremonies Pierre rose and began
his address

Dear Brothers he began blushing and stammering with a written
speech in his hand it is not sufficient to observe our mysteries in
the seclusion of our lodgewe must actact We are drowsing but we must
act Pierre raised his notebook and began to read

For the dissemination of pure truth and to secure the triumph of
virtue he read we must cleanse men from prejudice diffuse
principles in harmony with the spirit of the times undertake the
education of the young unite ourselves in indissoluble bonds with the
wisest men boldly yet prudently overcome superstitions infidelity and
folly and form of those devoted to us a body linked together by unity
of purpose and possessed of authority and power

To attain this end we must secure a preponderance of virtue over vice
and must endeavor to secure that the honest man may even in this world
receive a lasting reward for his virtue But in these great endeavors we
are gravely hampered by the political institutions of today What is to
be done in these circumstances To favor revolutions overthrow
everything repel force by force No We are very far from that
Every violent reform deserves censure for it quite fails to remedy evil
while men remain what they are and also because wisdom needs no
violence

The whole plan of our order should be based on the idea of preparing
men of firmness and virtue bound together by unity of convictionaiming
at the punishment of vice and folly and patronizing talent and virtue
raising worthy men from the dust and attaching them to our Brotherhood
Only then will our order have the power unobtrusively to bind the hands
of the protectors of disorder and to control them without their being
aware of it In a word we must found a form of government holding
universal sway which should be diffused over the whole world without
destroying the bonds of citizenship and beside which all other
governments can continue in their customary course and do everything
except what impedes the great aim of our order which is to obtain for
virtue the victory over vice This aim was that of Christianity itself
It taught men to be wise and good and for their own benefit to follow
the example and instruction of the best and wisest men

At that time when everything was plunged in darkness preaching alone
was of course sufficient The novelty of Truth endowed her with special
strength but now we need much more powerful methods It is now
necessary that man governed by his senses should find in virtue a
charm palpable to those senses It is impossible to eradicate the
passions but we must strive to direct them to a noble aim and it is
therefore necessary that everyone should be able to satisfy his passions
within the limits of virtue Our order should provide means to that end

As soon as we have a certain number of worthy men in every state each
of them again training two others and all being closely united
everything will be possible for our order which has already in secret
accomplished much for the welfare of mankind

This speech not only made a strong impression but created excitement in
the lodge The majority of the Brothers seeing in it dangerous designs
of Illuminism met it with a coldness that surprised Pierre The Grand
Master began answering him and Pierre began developing his views with
more and more warmth It was long since there had been so stormy a
meeting Parties were formed some accusing Pierre of Illuminism others
supporting him At that meeting he was struck for the first time by the
endless variety of mens minds which prevents a truth from ever
presenting itself identically to two persons Even those members who
seemed to be on his side understood him in their own way with
limitations and alterations he could not agree to as what he always
wanted most was to convey his thought to others just as he himself
understood it

 The Illuminati sought to substitute republican for monarchical
institutions

At the end of the meeting the Grand Master with irony and illwill
reproved Bezkhov for his vehemence and said it was not love of virtue
alone but also a love of strife that had moved him in the dispute
Pierre did not answer him and asked briefly whether his proposal would
be accepted He was told that it would not and without waiting for the
usual formalities he left the lodge and went home





CHAPTER VIII

Again Pierre was overtaken by the depression he so dreaded For three
days after the delivery of his speech at the lodge he lay on a sofa at
home receiving no one and going nowhere

It was just then that he received a letter from his wife who implored
him to see her telling him how grieved she was about him and how she
wished to devote her whole life to him

At the end of the letter she informed him that in a few days she would
return to Petersburg from abroad

Following this letter one of the masonic Brothers whom Pierre respected
less than the others forced his way in to see him and turning the
conversation upon Pierres matrimonial affairs by way of fraternal
advice expressed the opinion that his severity to his wife was wrong and
that he was neglecting one of the first rules of Freemasonry by not
forgiving the penitent

At the same time his motherinlaw Prince Vaslis wife sent to him
imploring him to come if only for a few minutes to discuss a most
important matter Pierre saw that there was a conspiracy against him and
that they wanted to reunite him with his wife and in the mood he then
was this was not even unpleasant to him Nothing mattered to him
Nothing in life seemed to him of much importance and under the
influence of the depression that possessed him he valued neither his
liberty nor his resolution to punish his wife

No one is right and no one is to blame so she too is not to blame he
thought

If he did not at once give his consent to a reunion with his wife it
was only because in his state of depression he did not feel able to take
any step Had his wife come to him he would not have turned her away
Compared to what preoccupied him was it not a matter of indifference
whether he lived with his wife or not

Without replying either to his wife or his motherinlaw Pierre late
one night prepared for a journey and started for Moscow to see Joseph
Alexeevich This is what he noted in his diary

Moscow 17th November

I have just returned from my benefactor and hasten to write down what I
have experienced Joseph Alexeevich is living poorly and has for three
years been suffering from a painful disease of the bladder No one has
ever heard him utter a groan or a word of complaint From morning till
late at night except when he eats his very plain food he is working at
science He received me graciously and made me sit down on the bed on
which he lay I made the sign of the Knights of the East and of
Jerusalem and he responded in the same manner asking me with a mild
smile what I had learned and gained in the Prussian and Scottish lodges
I told him everything as best I could and told him what I had proposed
to our Petersburg lodge of the bad reception I had encountered and of
my rupture with the Brothers Joseph Alexeevich having remained silent
and thoughtful for a good while told me his view of the matter which
at once lit up for me my whole past and the future path I should follow
He surprised me by asking whether I remembered the threefold aim of the
order 1 The preservation and study of the mystery 2 The
purification and reformation of oneself for its reception and 3 The
improvement of the human race by striving for such purification Which
is the principal aim of these three Certainly selfreformation and
selfpurification Only to this aim can we always strive independently
of circumstances But at the same time just this aim demands the
greatest efforts of us and so led astray by pride losing sight of
this aim we occupy ourselves either with the mystery which in our
impurity we are unworthy to receive or seek the reformation of the
human race while ourselves setting an example of baseness and
profligacy Illuminism is not a pure doctrine just because it is
attracted by social activity and puffed up by pride On this ground
Joseph Alexeevich condemned my speech and my whole activity and in the
depth of my soul I agreed with him Talking of my family affairs he said
to me the chief duty of a true Mason as I have told you lies in
perfecting himself We often think that by removing all the difficulties
of our life we shall more quickly reach our aim but on the contrary my
dear sir it is only in the midst of worldly cares that we can attain
our three chief aims 1 Selfknowledgefor man can only know himself
by comparison 2 Selfperfecting which can only be attained by
conflict and 3 The attainment of the chief virtuelove of death Only
the vicissitudes of life can show us its vanity and develop our innate
love of death or of rebirth to a new life These words are all the more
remarkable because in spite of his great physical sufferings Joseph
Alexeevich is never weary of life though he loves death for whichin
spite of the purity and loftiness of his inner manhe does not yet feel
himself sufficiently prepared My benefactor then explained to me fully
the meaning of the Great Square of creation and pointed out to me that
the numbers three and seven are the basis of everything He advised me
not to avoid intercourse with the Petersburg Brothers but to take up
only secondgrade posts in the lodge to try while diverting the
Brothers from pride to turn them toward the true path selfknowledge
and selfperfecting Besides this he advised me for myself personally
above all to keep a watch over myself and to that end he gave me a
notebook the one I am now writing in and in which I will in future note
down all my actions

Petersburg 23rd November

I am again living with my wife My motherinlaw came to me in tears and
said that Hlne was here and that she implored me to hear her that she
was innocent and unhappy at my desertion and much more I knew that if
I once let myself see her I should not have strength to go on refusing
what she wanted In my perplexity I did not know whose aid and advice to
seek Had my benefactor been here he would have told me what to do I
went to my room and reread Joseph Alexeevichs letters and recalled my
conversations with him and deduced from it all that I ought not to
refuse a supplicant and ought to reach a helping hand to
everyoneespecially to one so closely bound to meand that I must bear
my cross But if I forgive her for the sake of doing right then let
union with her have only a spiritual aim That is what I decided and
what I wrote to Joseph Alexeevich I told my wife that I begged her to
forget the past to forgive me whatever wrong I may have done her and
that I had nothing to forgive It gave me joy to tell her this She need
not know how hard it was for me to see her again I have settled on the
upper floor of this big house and am experiencing a happy feeling of
regeneration





CHAPTER IX

At that time as always happens the highest society that met at court
and at the grand balls was divided into several circles each with its
own particular tone The largest of these was the French circle of the
Napoleonic alliance the circle of Count Rumyntsev and Caulaincourt In
this group Hlne as soon as she had settled in Petersburg with her
husband took a very prominent place She was visited by the members of
the French embassy and by many belonging to that circle and noted for
their intellect and polished manners

Hlne had been at Erfurt during the famous meeting of the Emperors and
had brought from there these connections with the Napoleonic
notabilities At Erfurt her success had been brilliant Napoleon himself
had noticed her in the theater and said of her Cest un superbe
animal Her success as a beautiful and elegant woman did not surprise
Pierre for she had become even handsomer than before What did surprise
him was that during these last two years his wife had succeeded in
gaining the reputation d une femme charmante aussi spirituelle que
belle 2 The distinguished Prince de Ligne wrote her eightpage
letters Bilibin saved up his epigrams to produce them in Countess
Bezkhovas presence To be received in the Countess Bezkhovas salon
was regarded as a diploma of intellect Young men read books before
attending Hlnes evenings to have something to say in her salon and
secretaries of the embassy and even ambassadors confided diplomatic
secrets to her so that in a way Hlne was a power Pierre who knew
she was very stupid sometimes attended with a strange feeling of
perplexity and fear her evenings and dinner parties where politics
poetry and philosophy were discussed At these parties his feelings
were like those of a conjuror who always expects his trick to be found
out at any moment But whether because stupidity was just what was
needed to run such a salon or because those who were deceived found
pleasure in the deception at any rate it remained unexposed and Hlne
Bezkhovas reputation as a lovely and clever woman became so firmly
established that she could say the emptiest and stupidest things and
everybody would go into raptures over every word of hers and look for a
profound meaning in it of which she herself had no conception

 Thats a superb animal

 2 Of a charming woman as witty as she is lovely

Pierre was just the husband needed for a brilliant society woman He was
that absentminded crank a grand seigneur husband who was in no ones
way and far from spoiling the high tone and general impression of the
drawing room he served by the contrast he presented to her as an
advantageous background to his elegant and tactful wife Pierre during
the last two years as a result of his continual absorption in abstract
interests and his sincere contempt for all else had acquired in his
wifes circle which did not interest him that air of unconcern
indifference and benevolence toward all which cannot be acquired
artificially and therefore inspires involuntary respect He entered his
wifes drawing room as one enters a theater was acquainted with
everybody equally pleased to see everyone and equally indifferent to
them all Sometimes he joined in a conversation which interested him
and regardless of whether any gentlemen of the embassy were present
or not lispingly expressed his views which were sometimes not at all
in accord with the accepted tone of the moment But the general opinion
concerning the queer husband of the most distinguished woman in
Petersburg was so well established that no one took his freaks
seriously

Among the many young men who frequented her house every day Bors
Drubetsky who had already achieved great success in the service was
the most intimate friend of the Bezkhov household since Hlnes return
from Erfurt Hlne spoke of him as mon page and treated him like a
child Her smile for him was the same as for everybody but sometimes
that smile made Pierre uncomfortable Toward him Bors behaved with a
particularly dignified and sad deference This shade of deference also
disturbed Pierre He had suffered so painfully three years before from
the mortification to which his wife had subjected him that he now
protected himself from the danger of its repetition first by not being
a husband to his wife and secondly by not allowing himself to suspect

No now that she has become a bluestocking she has finally renounced
her former infatuations he told himself There has never been an
instance of a bluestocking being carried away by affairs of the hearta
statement which though gathered from an unknown source he believed
implicitly Yet strange to say Bors presence in his wifes drawing
room and he was almost always there had a physical effect upon Pierre
it constricted his limbs and destroyed the unconsciousness and freedom
of his movements

What a strange antipathy thought Pierre yet I used to like him very
much

In the eyes of the world Pierre was a great gentleman the rather blind
and absurd husband of a distinguished wife a clever crank who did
nothing but harmed nobody and was a firstrate goodnatured fellow But
a complex and difficult process of internal development was taking place
all this time in Pierres soul revealing much to him and causing him
many spiritual doubts and joys





CHAPTER X

Pierre went on with his diary and this is what he wrote in it during
that time

24th November

Got up at eight read the Scriptures then went to my duties By Joseph
Alexeevichs advice Pierre had entered the service of the state and
served on one of the committees Returned home for dinner and dined
alonethe countess had many visitors I do not like I ate and drank
moderately and after dinner copied out some passages for the Brothers
In the evening I went down to the countess and told a funny story about
B and only remembered that I ought not to have done so when everybody
laughed loudly at it

I am going to bed with a happy and tranquil mind Great God help me to
walk in Thy paths 1 to conquer anger by calmness and deliberation
2 to vanquish lust by selfrestraint and repulsion 3 to withdraw
from worldliness but not avoid a the service of the state b family
duties c relations with my friends and the management of my affairs

27th November

I got up late On waking I lay long in bed yielding to sloth O God
help and strengthen me that I may walk in Thy ways Read the Scriptures
but without proper feeling Brother Urusov came and we talked about
worldly vanities He told me of the Emperors new projects I began to
criticize them but remembered my rules and my benefactors wordsthat a
true Freemason should be a zealous worker for the state when his aid is
required and a quiet onlooker when not called on to assist My tongue is
my enemy Brothers G V and O visited me and we had a preliminary talk
about the reception of a new Brother They laid on me the duty of
Rhetor I feel myself weak and unworthy Then our talk turned to the
interpretation of the seven pillars and steps of the Temple the seven
sciences the seven virtues the seven vices and the seven gifts of the
Holy Spirit Brother O was very eloquent In the evening the admission
took place The new decoration of the Premises contributed much to the
magnificence of the spectacle It was Bors Drubetsky who was admitted
I nominated him and was the Rhetor A strange feeling agitated me all
the time I was alone with him in the dark chamber I caught myself
harboring a feeling of hatred toward him which I vainly tried to
overcome That is why I should really like to save him from evil and
lead him into the path of truth but evil thoughts of him did not leave
me It seemed to me that his object in entering the Brotherhood was
merely to be intimate and in favor with members of our lodge Apart from
the fact that he had asked me several times whether N and S were
members of our lodge a question to which I could not reply and that
according to my observation he is incapable of feeling respect for our
holy order and is too preoccupied and satisfied with the outer man to
desire spiritual improvement I had no cause to doubt him but he seemed
to me insincere and all the time I stood alone with him in the dark
temple it seemed to me that he was smiling contemptuously at my words
and I wished really to stab his bare breast with the sword I held to it
I could not be eloquent nor could I frankly mention my doubts to the
Brothers and to the Grand Master Great Architect of Nature help me to
find the true path out of the labyrinth of lies

After this three pages were left blank in the diary and then the
following was written

I have had a long and instructive talk alone with Brother V who
advised me to hold fast by Brother A Though I am unworthy much was
revealed to me Adonai is the name of the creator of the world Elohim
is the name of the ruler of all The third name is the name unutterable
which means the All Talks with Brother V strengthen refresh and
support me in the path of virtue In his presence doubt has no place
The distinction between the poor teachings of mundane science and our
sacred allembracing teaching is clear to me Human sciences dissect
everything to comprehend it and kill everything to examine it In the
holy science of our order all is one all is known in its entirety and
life The Trinitythe three elements of matterare sulphur mercury and
salt Sulphur is of an oily and fiery nature in combination with salt
by its fiery nature it arouses a desire in the latter by means of which
it attracts mercury seizes it holds it and in combination produces
other bodies Mercury is a fluid volatile spiritual essence Christ
the Holy Spirit Him

3rd December

Awoke late read the Scriptures but was apathetic Afterwards went and
paced up and down the large hall I wished to meditate but instead my
imagination pictured an occurrence of four years ago when Dlokhov
meeting me in Moscow after our duel said he hoped I was enjoying
perfect peace of mind in spite of my wifes absence At the time I gave
him no answer Now I recalled every detail of that meeting and in my
mind gave him the most malevolent and bitter replies I recollected
myself and drove away that thought only when I found myself glowing with
anger but I did not sufficiently repent Afterwards Bors Drubetsky
came and began relating various adventures His coming vexed me from the
first and I said something disagreeable to him He replied I flared up
and said much that was unpleasant and even rude to him He became
silent and I recollected myself only when it was too late My God I
cannot get on with him at all The cause of this is my egotism I set
myself above him and so become much worse than he for he is lenient to
my rudeness while I on the contrary nourish contempt for him O God
grant that in his presence I may rather see my own vileness and behave
so that he too may benefit After dinner I fell asleep and as I was
drowsing off I clearly heard a voice saying in my left ear Thy day

I dreamed that I was walking in the dark and was suddenly surrounded by
dogs but I went on undismayed Suddenly a smallish dog seized my left
thigh with its teeth and would not let go I began to throttle it with
my hands Scarcely had I torn it off before another a bigger one began
biting me I lifted it up but the higher I lifted it the bigger and
heavier it grew And suddenly Brother A came and taking my arm led me
to a building to enter which we had to pass along a narrow plank I
stepped on it but it bent and gave way and I began to clamber up a
fence which I could scarcely reach with my hands After much effort I
dragged myself up so that my leg hung down on one side and my body on
the other I looked round and saw Brother A standing on the fence and
pointing me to a broad avenue and garden and in the garden was a large
and beautiful building I woke up O Lord great Architect of Nature
help me to tear from myself these dogsmy passions especially the last
which unites in itself the strength of all the former ones and aid me
to enter that temple of virtue to a vision of which I attained in my
dream

7th December

I dreamed that Joseph Alexeevich was sitting in my house and that I was
very glad and wished to entertain him It seemed as if I chattered
incessantly with other people and suddenly remembered that this could
not please him and I wished to come close to him and embrace him But
as soon as I drew near I saw that his face had changed and grown young
and he was quietly telling me something about the teaching of our order
but so softly that I could not hear it Then it seemed that we all left
the room and something strange happened We were sitting or lying on the
floor He was telling me something and I wished to show him my
sensibility and not listening to what he was saying I began picturing
to myself the condition of my inner man and the grace of God sanctifying
me And tears came into my eyes and I was glad he noticed this But he
looked at me with vexation and jumped up breaking off his remarks I
felt abashed and asked whether what he had been saying did not concern
me but he did not reply gave me a kind look and then we suddenly
found ourselves in my bedroom where there is a double bed He lay down
on the edge of it and I burned with longing to caress him and lie down
too And he said Tell me frankly what is your chief temptation Do you
know it I think you know it already Abashed by this question I
replied that sloth was my chief temptation He shook his head
incredulously and even more abashed I said that though I was living
with my wife as he advised I was not living with her as her husband To
this he replied that one should not deprive a wife of ones embraces and
gave me to understand that that was my duty But I replied that I should
be ashamed to do it and suddenly everything vanished And I awoke and
found in my mind the text from the Gospel The life was the light of
men And the light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehended it
not Joseph Alexeevichs face had looked young and bright That day I
received a letter from my benefactor in which he wrote about conjugal
duties

9th December

I had a dream from which I awoke with a throbbing heart I saw that I
was in Moscow in my house in the big sitting room and Joseph
Alexeevich came in from the drawing room I seemed to know at once that
the process of regeneration had already taken place in him and I rushed
to meet him I embraced him and kissed his hands and he said Hast
thou noticed that my face is different I looked at him still holding
him in my arms and saw that his face was young but that he had no hair
on his head and his features were quite changed And I said I should
have known you had I met you by chance and I thought to myself Am I
telling the truth And suddenly I saw him lying like a dead body then
he gradually recovered and went with me into my study carrying a large
book of sheets of drawing paper I said I drew that and he answered
by bowing his head I opened the book and on all the pages there were
excellent drawings And in my dream I knew that these drawings
represented the love adventures of the soul with its beloved And on its
pages I saw a beautiful representation of a maiden in transparent
garments and with a transparent body flying up to the clouds And I
seemed to know that this maiden was nothing else than a representation
of the Song of Songs And looking at those drawings I dreamed I felt
that I was doing wrong but could not tear myself away from them Lord
help me My God if Thy forsaking me is Thy doing Thy will be done but
if I am myself the cause teach me what I should do I shall perish of
my debauchery if Thou utterly desertest me





CHAPTER XI

The Rostvs monetary affairs had not improved during the two years they
had spent in the country

Though Nicholas Rostv had kept firmly to his resolution and was still
serving modestly in an obscure regiment spending comparatively little
the way of life at OtradnoeMitenkas management of affairs in
particularwas such that the debts inevitably increased every year The
only resource obviously presenting itself to the old count was to apply
for an official post so he had come to Petersburg to look for one and
also as he said to let the lassies enjoy themselves for the last time

Soon after their arrival in Petersburg Berg proposed to Vra and was
accepted

Though in Moscow the Rostvs belonged to the best society without
themselves giving it a thought yet in Petersburg their circle of
acquaintances was a mixed and indefinite one In Petersburg they were
provincials and the very people they had entertained in Moscow without
inquiring to what set they belonged here looked down on them

The Rostvs lived in the same hospitable way in Petersburg as in Moscow
and the most diverse people met at their suppers Country neighbors from
Otradnoe impoverished old squires and their daughters Peronskaya a
maid of honor Pierre Bezkhov and the son of their district postmaster
who had obtained a post in Petersburg Among the men who very soon
became frequent visitors at the Rostvs house in Petersburg were Bors
Pierre whom the count had met in the street and dragged home with him
and Berg who spent whole days at the Rostvs and paid the eldest
daughter Countess Vra the attentions a young man pays when he intends
to propose

Not in vain had Berg shown everybody his right hand wounded at
Austerlitz and held a perfectly unnecessary sword in his left He
narrated that episode so persistently and with so important an air that
everyone believed in the merit and usefulness of his deed and he had
obtained two decorations for Austerlitz

In the Finnish war he also managed to distinguish himself He had picked
up the scrap of a grenade that had killed an aidedecamp standing near
the commanderinchief and had taken it to his commander Just as he had
done after Austerlitz he related this occurrence at such length and so
insistently that everyone again believed it had been necessary to do
this and he received two decorations for the Finnish war also In 1809
he was a captain in the Guards wore medals and held some special
lucrative posts in Petersburg

Though some skeptics smiled when told of Bergs merits it could not be
denied that he was a painstaking and brave officer on excellent terms
with his superiors and a moral young man with a brilliant career before
him and an assured position in society

Four years before meeting a German comrade in the stalls of a Moscow
theater Berg had pointed out Vra Rostva to him and had said in
German das soll mein Weib werden and from that moment had made up
his mind to marry her Now in Petersburg having considered the Rostvs
position and his own he decided that the time had come to propose

 That girl shall be my wife

Bergs proposal was at first received with a perplexity that was not
flattering to him At first it seemed strange that the son of an obscure
Livonian gentleman should propose marriage to a Countess Rostva but
Bergs chief characteristic was such a nave and good natured egotism
that the Rostvs involuntarily came to think it would be a good thing
since he himself was so firmly convinced that it was good indeed
excellent Moreover the Rostvs affairs were seriously embarrassed as
the suitor could not but know and above all Vra was twentyfour had
been taken out everywhere and though she was certainly goodlooking and
sensible no one up to now had proposed to her So they gave their
consent

You see said Berg to his comrade whom he called friend only
because he knew that everyone has friends you see I have considered
it all and should not marry if I had not thought it all out or if it
were in any way unsuitable But on the contrary my papa and mamma are
now provided forI have arranged that rent for them in the Baltic
Provincesand I can live in Petersburg on my pay and with her fortune
and my good management we can get along nicely I am not marrying for
moneyI consider that dishonorablebut a wife should bring her share and
a husband his I have my position in the service she has connections
and some means In our times that is worth something isnt it But
above all she is a handsome estimable girl and she loves me

Berg blushed and smiled

And I love her because her character is sensible and very good Now
the other sister though they are the same family is quite differentan
unpleasant character and has not the same intelligence She is so you
know Unpleasant But my fiancee Well you will be coming he
was going to say to dine but changed his mind and said to take tea
with us and quickly doubling up his tongue he blew a small round ring
of tobacco smoke perfectly embodying his dream of happiness

After the first feeling of perplexity aroused in the parents by Bergs
proposal the holiday tone of joyousness usual at such times took
possession of the family but the rejoicing was external and insincere
In the familys feeling toward this wedding a certain awkwardness and
constraint was evident as if they were ashamed of not having loved Vra
sufficiently and of being so ready to get her off their hands The old
count felt this most He would probably have been unable to state the
cause of his embarrassment but it resulted from the state of his
affairs He did not know at all how much he had what his debts amounted
to or what dowry he could give Vra When his daughters were born he
had assigned to each of them for her dowry an estate with three
hundred serfs but one of these estates had already been sold and the
other was mortgaged and the interest so much in arrears that it would
have to be sold so that it was impossible to give it to Vra Nor had
he any money

Berg had already been engaged a month and only a week remained before
the wedding but the count had not yet decided in his own mind the
question of the dowry nor spoken to his wife about it At one time the
count thought of giving her the Ryazan estate or of selling a forest at
another time of borrowing money on a note of hand A few days before the
wedding Berg entered the counts study early one morning and with a
pleasant smile respectfully asked his future fatherinlaw to let him
know what Vras dowry would be The count was so disconcerted by this
longforeseen inquiry that without consideration he gave the first reply
that came into his head I like your being businesslike about it I
like it You shall be satisfied

And patting Berg on the shoulder he got up wishing to end the
conversation But Berg smiling pleasantly explained that if he did not
know for certain how much Vra would have and did not receive at least
part of the dowry in advance he would have to break matters off

Because consider Countif I allowed myself to marry now without
having definite means to maintain my wife I should be acting badly

The conversation ended by the count who wished to be generous and to
avoid further importunity saying that he would give a note of hand for
eighty thousand rubles Berg smiled meekly kissed the count on the
shoulder and said that he was very grateful but that it was impossible
for him to arrange his new life without receiving thirty thousand in
ready money Or at least twenty thousand Count he added and then a
note of hand for only sixty thousand

Yes yes all right said the count hurriedly Only excuse me my
dear fellow Ill give you twenty thousand and a note of hand for eighty
thousand as well Yes yes Kiss me





CHAPTER XII

Natsha was sixteen and it was the year 1809 the very year to which she
had counted on her fingers with Bors after they had kissed four years
ago Since then she had not seen him Before Snya and her mother if
Bors happened to be mentioned she spoke quite freely of that episode
as of some childish longforgotten matter that was not worth
mentioning But in the secret depths of her soul the question whether
her engagement to Bors was a jest or an important binding promise
tormented her

Since Bors left Moscow in 1805 to join the army he had not seen the
Rostvs He had been in Moscow several times and had passed near
Otradnoe but had never been to see them

Sometimes it occurred to Natsha that he did not wish to see her and
this conjecture was confirmed by the sad tone in which her elders spoke
of him

Nowadays old friends are not remembered the countess would say when
Bors was mentioned

Anna Mikhylovna also had of late visited them less frequently seemed
to hold herself with particular dignity and always spoke rapturously
and gratefully of the merits of her son and the brilliant career on
which he had entered When the Rostvs came to Petersburg Bors called
on them

He drove to their house in some agitation The memory of Natsha was his
most poetic recollection But he went with the firm intention of letting
her and her parents feel that the childish relations between himself and
Natsha could not be binding either on her or on him He had a brilliant
position in society thanks to his intimacy with Countess Bezkhova a
brilliant position in the service thanks to the patronage of an
important personage whose complete confidence he enjoyed and he was
beginning to make plans for marrying one of the richest heiresses in
Petersburg plans which might very easily be realized When he entered
the Rostvs drawing room Natsha was in her own room When she heard of
his arrival she almost ran into the drawing room flushed and beaming
with a more than cordial smile

Bors remembered Natsha in a short dress with dark eyes shining from
under her curls and boisterous childish laughter as he had known her
four years before and so he was taken aback when quite a different
Natsha entered and his face expressed rapturous astonishment This
expression on his face pleased Natsha

Well do you recognize your little madcap playmate asked the
countess

Bors kissed Natshas hand and said that he was astonished at the
change in her

How handsome you have grown

I should think so replied Natshas laughing eyes

And is Papa older she asked

Natsha sat down and without joining in Bors conversation with the
countess silently and minutely studied her childhoods suitor He felt
the weight of that resolute and affectionate scrutiny and glanced at her
occasionally

Bors uniform spurs tie and the way his hair was brushed were all
comme il faut and in the latest fashion This Natsha noticed at once
He sat rather sideways in the armchair next to the countess arranging
with his right hand the cleanest of gloves that fitted his left hand
like a skin and he spoke with a particularly refined compression of his
lips about the amusements of the highest Petersburg society recalling
with mild irony old times in Moscow and Moscow acquaintances It was not
accidentally Natsha felt that he alluded when speaking of the
highest aristocracy to an ambassadors ball he had attended and to
invitations he had received from NN and SS

All this time Natsha sat silent glancing up at him from under her
brows This gaze disturbed and confused Bors more and more He looked
round more frequently toward her and broke off in what he was saying
He did not stay more than ten minutes then rose and took his leave The
same inquisitive challenging and rather mocking eyes still looked at
him After his first visit Bors said to himself that Natsha attracted
him just as much as ever but that he must not yield to that feeling
because to marry her a girl almost without fortune would mean ruin to
his career while to renew their former relations without intending to
marry her would be dishonorable Bors made up his mind to avoid meeting
Natsha but despite that resolution he called again a few days later
and began calling often and spending whole days at the Rostvs It
seemed to him that he ought to have an explanation with Natsha and tell
her that the old times must be forgotten that in spite of everything
she could not be his wife that he had no means and they would never
let her marry him But he failed to do so and felt awkward about
entering on such an explanation From day to day he became more and more
entangled It seemed to her mother and Snya that Natsha was in love
with Bors as of old She sang him his favorite songs showed him her
album making him write in it did not allow him to allude to the past
letting it be understood how delightful was the present and every day
he went away in a fog without having said what he meant to and not
knowing what he was doing or why he came or how it would all end He
left off visiting Hlne and received reproachful notes from her every
day and yet he continued to spend whole days with the Rostvs





CHAPTER XIII

One night when the old countess in nightcap and dressing jacket
without her false curls and with her poor little knob of hair showing
under her white cotton cap knelt sighing and groaning on a rug and
bowing to the ground in prayer her door creaked and Natsha also in a
dressing jacket with slippers on her bare feet and her hair in
curlpapers ran in The countessher prayerful mood dispelledlooked
round and frowned She was finishing her last prayer Can it be that
this couch will be my grave Natsha flushed and eager seeing her
mother in prayer suddenly checked her rush half sat down and
unconsciously put out her tongue as if chiding herself Seeing that her
mother was still praying she ran on tiptoe to the bed and rapidly
slipping one little foot against the other pushed off her slippers and
jumped onto the bed the countess had feared might become her grave This
couch was high with a feather bed and five pillows each smaller than
the one below Natsha jumped on it sank into the feather bed rolled
over to the wall and began snuggling up the bedclothes as she settled
down raising her knees to her chin kicking out and laughing almost
inaudibly now covering herself up head and all and now peeping at her
mother The countess finished her prayers and came to the bed with a
stern face but seeing that Natshas head was covered she smiled in
her kind weak way

Now then now then said she

Mamma can we have a talk Yes said Natsha Now just one on your
throat and another thatll do And seizing her mother round the
neck she kissed her on the throat In her behavior to her mother
Natsha seemed rough but she was so sensitive and tactful that however
she clasped her mother she always managed to do it without hurting her
or making her feel uncomfortable or displeased

Well what is it tonight said the mother having arranged her pillows
and waited until Natsha after turning over a couple of times had
settled down beside her under the quilt spread out her arms and
assumed a serious expression

These visits of Natshas at night before the count returned from his
club were one of the greatest pleasures of both mother and daughter

What is it tonightBut I have to tell you

Natsha put her hand on her mothers mouth

About Bors I know she said seriously thats what I have come
about Dont say itI know No do tell me and she removed her hand
Tell me Mamma Hes nice

Natsha you are sixteen At your age I was married You say Bors is
nice He is very nice and I love him like a son But what then What
are you thinking about You have quite turned his head I can see
that

As she said this the countess looked round at her daughter Natsha was
lying looking steadily straight before her at one of the mahogany
sphinxes carved on the corners of the bedstead so that the countess
only saw her daughters face in profile That face struck her by its
peculiarly serious and concentrated expression

Natsha was listening and considering

Well what then said she

You have quite turned his head and why What do you want of him You
know you cant marry him

Why not said Natsha without changing her position

Because he is young because he is poor because he is a relation
and because you yourself dont love him

How do you know

I know It is not right darling

But if I want to said Natsha

Leave off talking nonsense said the countess

But if I want to

Natsha I am in earnest

Natsha did not let her finish She drew the countess large hand to
her kissed it on the back and then on the palm then again turned it
over and began kissing first one knuckle then the space between the
knuckles then the next knuckle whispering January February March
April May Speak Mamma why dont you say anything Speak said she
turning to her mother who was tenderly gazing at her daughter and in
that contemplation seemed to have forgotten all she had wished to say

It wont do my love Not everyone will understand this friendship
dating from your childish days and to see him so intimate with you may
injure you in the eyes of other young men who visit us and above all it
torments him for nothing He may already have found a suitable and
wealthy match and now hes half crazy

Crazy repeated Natsha

Ill tell you some things about myself I had a cousin

I know Cyril Matveich but he is old

He was not always old But this is what Ill do Natsha Ill have a
talk with Bors He need not come so often

Why not if he likes to

Because I know it will end in nothing

How can you know No Mamma dont speak to him What nonsense said
Natsha in the tone of one being deprived of her property Well I
wont marry but let him come if he enjoys it and I enjoy it Natsha
smiled and looked at her mother Not to marry but just so she added

How so my pet

Just so Theres no need for me to marry him But just so

Just so just so repeated the countess and shaking all over she
went off into a good humored unexpected elderly laugh

Dont laugh stop cried Natsha Youre shaking the whole bed
Youre awfully like me just such another giggler Wait and she
seized the countess hands and kissed a knuckle of the little finger
saying June and continued kissing July August on the other
hand But Mamma is he very much in love What do you think Was
anybody ever so much in love with you And hes very nice very very
nice Only not quite my tastehe is so narrow like the diningroom
clock Dont you understand Narrow you knowgray light gray

What rubbish youre talking said the countess

Natsha continued Dont you really understand Nicholas would
understand Bezkhov now is blue darkblue and red and he is
square

You flirt with him too said the countess laughing

No he is a Freemason I have found out He is fine darkblue and
red How can I explain it to you

Little countess the counts voice called from behind the door
Youre not asleep Natsha jumped up snatched up her slippers and
ran barefoot to her own room

It was a long time before she could sleep She kept thinking that no one
could understand all that she understood and all there was in her

Snya she thought glancing at that curledup sleeping little kitten
with her enormous plait of hair No how could she Shes virtuous She
fell in love with Nicholas and does not wish to know anything more Even
Mamma does not understand It is wonderful how clever I am and how
charming she is she went on speaking of herself in the third person
and imagining it was some very wise manthe wisest and best of menwho
was saying it of her There is everything everything in her
continued this man She is unusually intelligent charming and then
she is pretty uncommonly pretty and agileshe swims and rides
splendidly and her voice One can really say its a wonderful voice

She hummed a scrap from her favorite opera by Cherubini threw herself
on her bed laughed at the pleasant thought that she would immediately
fall asleep called Dunyasha the maid to put out the candle and before
Dunyasha had left the room had already passed into yet another happier
world of dreams where everything was as light and beautiful as in
reality and even more so because it was different

Next day the countess called Bors aside and had a talk with him after
which he ceased coming to the Rostvs





CHAPTER XIV

On the thirtyfirst of December New Years Eve 1809 10 an old
grandee of Catherines day was giving a ball and midnight supper The
diplomatic corps and the Emperor himself were to be present

The grandees wellknown mansion on the English Quay glittered with
innumerable lights Police were stationed at the brightly lit entrance
which was carpeted with red baize and not only gendarmes but dozens of
police officers and even the police master himself stood at the porch
Carriages kept driving away and fresh ones arriving with redliveried
footmen and footmen in plumed hats From the carriages emerged men
wearing uniforms stars and ribbons while ladies in satin and ermine
cautiously descended the carriage steps which were let down for them
with a clatter and then walked hurriedly and noiselessly over the baize
at the entrance

Almost every time a new carriage drove up a whisper ran through the
crowd and caps were doffed

The Emperor No a minister prince ambassador Dont you see
the plumes was whispered among the crowd

One person better dressed than the rest seemed to know everyone and
mentioned by name the greatest dignitaries of the day

A third of the visitors had already arrived but the Rostvs who were
to be present were still hurrying to get dressed

There had been many discussions and preparations for this ball in the
Rostv family many fears that the invitation would not arrive that the
dresses would not be ready or that something would not be arranged as
it should be

Mrya Ignatevna Peronskaya a thin and shallow maid of honor at the
court of the Dowager Empress who was a friend and relation of the
countess and piloted the provincial Rostvs in Petersburg high society
was to accompany them to the ball

They were to call for her at her house in the Taurida Gardens at ten
oclock but it was already five minutes to ten and the girls were not
yet dressed

Natsha was going to her first grand ball She had got up at eight that
morning and had been in a fever of excitement and activity all day All
her powers since morning had been concentrated on ensuring that they
allshe herself Mamma and Snyashould be as well dressed as possible
Snya and her mother put themselves entirely in her hands The countess
was to wear a claretcolored velvet dress and the two girls white gauze
over pink silk slips with roses on their bodices and their hair dressed
a la grecque

Everything essential had already been done feet hands necks and ears
washed perfumed and powdered as befits a ball the openwork silk
stockings and white satin shoes with ribbons were already on the
hairdressing was almost done Snya was finishing dressing and so was
the countess but Natsha who had bustled about helping them all was
behindhand She was still sitting before a lookingglass with a dressing
jacket thrown over her slender shoulders Snya stood ready dressed in
the middle of the room and pressing the head of a pin till it hurt her
dainty finger was fixing on a last ribbon that squeaked as the pin went
through it

Thats not the way thats not the way Snya cried Natsha turning
her head and clutching with both hands at her hair which the maid who
was dressing it had not time to release That bow is not right Come
here

Snya sat down and Natsha pinned the ribbon on differently

Allow me Miss I cant do it like that said the maid who was holding
Natshas hair

Oh dear Well then wait Thats right Snya

Arent you ready It is nearly ten came the countess voice

Directly Directly And you Mamma

I have only my cap to pin on

Dont do it without me called Natsha You wont do it right

But its already ten

They had decided to be at the ball by half past ten and Natsha had
still to get dressed and they had to call at the Taurida Gardens

When her hair was done Natsha in her short petticoat from under which
her dancing shoes showed and in her mothers dressing jacket ran up to
Snya scrutinized her and then ran to her mother Turning her mothers
head this way and that she fastened on the cap and hurriedly kissing
her gray hair ran back to the maids who were turning up the hem of her
skirt

The cause of the delay was Natshas skirt which was too long Two
maids were turning up the hem and hurriedly biting off the ends of
thread A third with pins in her mouth was running about between the
countess and Snya and a fourth held the whole of the gossamer garment
up high on one uplifted hand

Mavra quicker darling

Give me my thimble Miss from there

Whenever will you be ready asked the count coming to the door Here
is some scent Peronskaya must be tired of waiting

Its ready Miss said the maid holding up the shortened gauze dress
with two fingers and blowing and shaking something off it as if by
this to express a consciousness of the airiness and purity of what she
held

Natsha began putting on the dress

In a minute In a minute Dont come in Papa she cried to her father
as he opened the doorspeaking from under the filmy skirt which still
covered her whole face

Snya slammed the door to A minute later they let the count in He was
wearing a blue swallowtail coat shoes and stockings and was perfumed
and his hair pomaded

Oh Papa how nice you look Charming cried Natsha as she stood in
the middle of the room smoothing out the folds of the gauze

If you please Miss allow me said the maid who on her knees was
pulling the skirt straight and shifting the pins from one side of her
mouth to the other with her tongue

Say what you like exclaimed Snya in a despairing voice as she
looked at Natsha say what you like its still too long

Natsha stepped back to look at herself in the pier glass The dress was
too long

Really madam it is not at all too long said Mavra crawling on her
knees after her young lady

Well if its too long well tack it up well tack it up in one
minute said the resolute Dunyasha taking a needle that was stuck on
the front of her little shawl and still kneeling on the floor set to
work once more

At that moment with soft steps the countess came in shyly in her cap
and velvet gown

Oooo my beauty exclaimed the count she looks better than any of
you

He would have embraced her but blushing she stepped aside fearing to
be rumpled

Mamma your cap more to this side said Natsha Ill arrange it
and she rushed forward so that the maids who were tacking up her skirt
could not move fast enough and a piece of gauze was torn off

Oh goodness What has happened Really it was not my fault

Never mind Ill run it up it wont show said Dunyasha

What a beautya very queen said the nurse as she came to the door
And Snya They are lovely

At a quarter past ten they at last got into their carriages and started
But they had still to call at the Taurida Gardens

Peronskaya was quite ready In spite of her age and plainness she had
gone through the same process as the Rostvs but with less flurryfor
to her it was a matter of routine Her ugly old body was washed
perfumed and powdered in just the same way She had washed behind her
ears just as carefully and when she entered her drawing room in her
yellow dress wearing her badge as maid of honor her old ladys maid
was as full of rapturous admiration as the Rostvs servants had been

She praised the Rostvs toilets They praised her taste and toilet and
at eleven oclock careful of their coiffures and dresses they settled
themselves in their carriages and drove off





CHAPTER XV

Natsha had not had a moment free since early morning and had not once
had time to think of what lay before her

In the damp chill air and crowded closeness of the swaying carriage she
for the first time vividly imagined what was in store for her there at
the ball in those brightly lighted roomswith music flowers dances
the Emperor and all the brilliant young people of Petersburg The
prospect was so splendid that she hardly believed it would come true so
out of keeping was it with the chill darkness and closeness of the
carriage She understood all that awaited her only when after stepping
over the red baize at the entrance she entered the hall took off her
fur cloak and beside Snya and in front of her mother mounted the
brightly illuminated stairs between the flowers Only then did she
remember how she must behave at a ball and tried to assume the majestic
air she considered indispensable for a girl on such an occasion But
fortunately for her she felt her eyes growing misty she saw nothing
clearly her pulse beat a hundred to the minute and the blood throbbed
at her heart She could not assume that pose which would have made her
ridiculous and she moved on almost fainting from excitement and trying
with all her might to conceal it And this was the very attitude that
became her best Before and behind them other visitors were entering
also talking in low tones and wearing ball dresses The mirrors on the
landing reflected ladies in white paleblue and pink dresses with
diamonds and pearls on their bare necks and arms

Natsha looked in the mirrors and could not distinguish her reflection
from the others All was blended into one brilliant procession On
entering the ballroom the regular hum of voices footsteps and
greetings deafened Natsha and the light and glitter dazzled her still
more The host and hostess who had already been standing at the door
for half an hour repeating the same words to the various arrivals
Charme de vous voir greeted the Rostvs and Peronskaya in the same
manner

 Delighted to see you

The two girls in their white dresses each with a rose in her black
hair both curtsied in the same way but the hostess eye involuntarily
rested longer on the slim Natsha She looked at her and gave her alone
a special smile in addition to her usual smile as hostess Looking at
her she may have recalled the golden irrecoverable days of her own
girlhood and her own first ball The host also followed Natsha with his
eyes and asked the count which was his daughter

Charming said he kissing the tips of his fingers

In the ballroom guests stood crowding at the entrance doors awaiting the
Emperor The countess took up a position in one of the front rows of
that crowd Natsha heard and felt that several people were asking about
her and looking at her She realized that those noticing her liked her
and this observation helped to calm her

There are some like ourselves and some worse she thought

Peronskaya was pointing out to the countess the most important people at
the ball

That is the Dutch ambassador do you see That grayhaired man she
said indicating an old man with a profusion of silvergray curly hair
who was surrounded by ladies laughing at something he said

Ah here she is the Queen of Petersburg Countess Bezkhova said
Peronskaya indicating Hlne who had just entered How lovely She is
quite equal to Mrya Antonovna See how the men young and old pay
court to her Beautiful and clever they say Princeis quite mad about
her But see those two though not goodlooking are even more run
after

She pointed to a lady who was crossing the room followed by a very plain
daughter

She is a splendid match a millionairess said Peronskaya And look
here come her suitors

That is Bezkhovas brother Anatole Kurgin she said indicating a
handsome officer of the Horse Guards who passed by them with head erect
looking at something over the heads of the ladies Hes handsome isnt
he I hear they will marry him to that rich girl But your cousin
Drubetsky is also very attentive to her They say she has millions Oh
yes thats the French ambassador himself she replied to the countess
inquiry about Caulaincourt Looks as if he were a king All the same
the French are charming very charming No one more charming in society
Ah here she is Yes she is still the most beautiful of them all our
Mrya Antonovna And how simply she is dressed Lovely And that stout
one in spectacles is the universal Freemason she went on indicating
Pierre Put him beside his wife and he looks a regular buffoon

Pierre swaying his stout body advanced making way through the crowd
and nodding to right and left as casually and goodnaturedly as if he
were passing through a crowd at a fair He pushed through evidently
looking for someone

Natsha looked joyfully at the familiar face of Pierre the buffoon
as Peronskaya had called him and knew he was looking for them and for
her in particular He had promised to be at the ball and introduce
partners to her

But before he reached them Pierre stopped beside a very handsome dark
man of middle height and in a white uniform who stood by a window
talking to a tall man wearing stars and a ribbon Natsha at once
recognized the shorter and younger man in the white uniform it was
Bolknski who seemed to her to have grown much younger happier and
betterlooking

Theres someone else we knowBolknski do you see Mamma said
Natsha pointing out Prince Andrew You remember he stayed a night
with us at Otradnoe

Oh you know him said Peronskaya I cant bear him Il fait a
present la pluie et le beau temps Hes too proud for anything Takes
after his father And hes hand in glove with Speranski writing some
project or other Just look how he treats the ladies Theres one
talking to him and he has turned away she said pointing at him Id
give it to him if he treated me as he does those ladies

 He is all the rage just now





CHAPTER XVI

Suddenly everybody stirred began talking and pressed forward and then
back and between the two rows which separated the Emperor entered to
the sounds of music that had immediately struck up Behind him walked
his host and hostess He walked in rapidly bowing to right and left as
if anxious to get the first moments of the reception over The band
played the polonaise in vogue at that time on account of the words that
had been set to it beginning Alexander Elisaveta all our hearts you
ravish quite The Emperor passed on to the drawing room the crowd
made a rush for the doors and several persons with excited faces
hurried there and back again Then the crowd hastily retired from the
drawing room door at which the Emperor reappeared talking to the
hostess A young man looking distraught pounced down on the ladies
asking them to move aside Some ladies with faces betraying complete
forgetfulness of all the rules of decorum pushed forward to the
detriment of their toilets The men began to choose partners and take
their places for the polonaise

Everyone moved back and the Emperor came smiling out of the drawing
room leading his hostess by the hand but not keeping time to the music
The host followed with Mrya Antonovna Naryshkina then came
ambassadors ministers and various generals whom Peronskaya diligently
named More than half the ladies already had partners and were taking
up or preparing to take up their positions for the polonaise Natsha
felt that she would be left with her mother and Snya among a minority
of women who crowded near the wall not having been invited to dance
She stood with her slender arms hanging down her scarcely defined bosom
rising and falling regularly and with bated breath and glittering
frightened eyes gazed straight before her evidently prepared for the
height of joy or misery She was not concerned about the Emperor or any
of those great people whom Peronskaya was pointing outshe had but one
thought Is it possible no one will ask me that I shall not be among
the first to dance Is it possible that not one of all these men will
notice me They do not even seem to see me or if they do they look as
if they were saying Ah shes not the one Im after so its not worth
looking at her No its impossible she thought They must know how
I long to dance how splendidly I dance and how they would enjoy
dancing with me

The strains of the polonaise which had continued for a considerable
time had begun to sound like a sad reminiscence to Natshas ears She
wanted to cry Peronskaya had left them The count was at the other end
of the room She and the countess and Snya were standing by themselves
as in the depths of a forest amid that crowd of strangers with no one
interested in them and not wanted by anyone Prince Andrew with a lady
passed by evidently not recognizing them The handsome Anatole was
smilingly talking to a partner on his arm and looked at Natsha as one
looks at a wall Bors passed them twice and each time turned away Berg
and his wife who were not dancing came up to them

This family gathering seemed humiliating to Natshaas if there were
nowhere else for the family to talk but here at the ball She did not
listen to or look at Vra who was telling her something about her own
green dress

At last the Emperor stopped beside his last partner he had danced with
three and the music ceased A worried aidedecamp ran up to the
Rostvs requesting them to stand farther back though as it was they
were already close to the wall and from the gallery resounded the
distinct precise enticingly rhythmical strains of a waltz The Emperor
looked smilingly down the room A minute passed but no one had yet begun
dancing An aidedecamp the Master of Ceremonies went up to Countess
Bezkhova and asked her to dance She smilingly raised her hand and laid
it on his shoulder without looking at him The aidedecamp an adept in
his art grasping his partner firmly round her waist with confident
deliberation started smoothly gliding first round the edge of the
circle then at the corner of the room he caught Hlnes left hand and
turned her the only sound audible apart from the everquickening
music being the rhythmic click of the spurs on his rapid agile feet
while at every third beat his partners velvet dress spread out and
seemed to flash as she whirled round Natsha gazed at them and was
ready to cry because it was not she who was dancing that first turn of
the waltz

Prince Andrew in the white uniform of a cavalry colonel wearing
stockings and dancing shoes stood looking animated and bright in the
front row of the circle not far from the Rostvs Baron Firhoff was
talking to him about the first sitting of the Council of State to be
held next day Prince Andrew as one closely connected with Speranski
and participating in the work of the legislative commission could give
reliable information about that sitting concerning which various rumors
were current But not listening to what Firhoff was saying he was
gazing now at the sovereign and now at the men intending to dance who
had not yet gathered courage to enter the circle

Prince Andrew was watching these men abashed by the Emperors presence
and the women who were breathlessly longing to be asked to dance

Pierre came up to him and caught him by the arm

You always dance I have a protegee the young Rostva here Ask her
he said

Where is she asked Bolknski Excuse me he added turning to the
baron we will finish this conversation elsewhereat a ball one must
dance He stepped forward in the direction Pierre indicated The
despairing dejected expression of Natshas face caught his eye He
recognized her guessed her feelings saw that it was her debut
remembered her conversation at the window and with an expression of
pleasure on his face approached Countess Rostva

Allow me to introduce you to my daughter said the countess with
heightened color

I have the pleasure of being already acquainted if the countess
remembers me said Prince Andrew with a low and courteous bow quite
belying Peronskayas remarks about his rudeness and approaching Natsha
he held out his arm to grasp her waist before he had completed his
invitation He asked her to waltz That tremulous expression on
Natshas face prepared either for despair or rapture suddenly
brightened into a happy grateful childlike smile

I have long been waiting for you that frightened happy little girl
seemed to say by the smile that replaced the threatened tears as she
raised her hand to Prince Andrews shoulder They were the second couple
to enter the circle Prince Andrew was one of the best dancers of his
day and Natsha danced exquisitely Her little feet in their white satin
dancing shoes did their work swiftly lightly and independently of
herself while her face beamed with ecstatic happiness Her slender bare
arms and neck were not beautifulcompared to Hlnes her shoulders
looked thin and her bosom undeveloped But Hlne seemed as it were
hardened by a varnish left by the thousands of looks that had scanned
her person while Natsha was like a girl exposed for the first time
who would have felt very much ashamed had she not been assured that this
was absolutely necessary

Prince Andrew liked dancing and wishing to escape as quickly as
possible from the political and clever talk which everyone addressed to
him wishing also to break up the circle of restraint he disliked
caused by the Emperors presence he danced and had chosen Natsha
because Pierre pointed her out to him and because she was the first
pretty girl who caught his eye but scarcely had he embraced that
slender supple figure and felt her stirring so close to him and smiling
so near him than the wine of her charm rose to his head and he felt
himself revived and rejuvenated when after leaving her he stood
breathing deeply and watching the other dancers





CHAPTER XVII

After Prince Andrew Bors came up to ask Natsha for a dance and then
the aidedecamp who had opened the ball and several other young men
so that flushed and happy and passing on her superfluous partners to
Snya she did not cease dancing all the evening She noticed and saw
nothing of what occupied everyone else Not only did she fail to notice
that the Emperor talked a long time with the French ambassador and how
particularly gracious he was to a certain lady or that Prince Soandso
and Soandso did and said this and that and that Hlne had great
success and was honored by the special attention of Soandso but she
did not even see the Emperor and only noticed that he had gone because
the ball became livelier after his departure For one of the merry
cotillions before supper Prince Andrew was again her partner He
reminded her of their first encounter in the Otradnoe avenue and how
she had been unable to sleep that moonlight night and told her how he
had involuntarily overheard her Natsha blushed at that recollection
and tried to excuse herself as if there had been something to be
ashamed of in what Prince Andrew had overheard

Like all men who have grown up in society Prince Andrew liked meeting
someone there not of the conventional society stamp And such was
Natsha with her surprise her delight her shyness and even her
mistakes in speaking French With her he behaved with special care and
tenderness sitting beside her and talking of the simplest and most
unimportant matters he admired her shy grace In the middle of the
cotillion having completed one of the figures Natsha still out of
breath was returning to her seat when another dancer chose her She was
tired and panting and evidently thought of declining but immediately
put her hand gaily on the mans shoulder smiling at Prince Andrew

Id be glad to sit beside you and rest Im tired but you see how they
keep asking me and Im glad of it Im happy and I love everybody and
you and I understand it all and much much more was said in her smile
When her partner left her Natsha ran across the room to choose two
ladies for the figure

If she goes to her cousin first and then to another lady she will be
my wife said Prince Andrew to himself quite to his own surprise as he
watched her She did go first to her cousin

What rubbish sometimes enters ones head thought Prince Andrew but
what is certain is that that girl is so charming so original that she
wont be dancing here a month before she will be married Such as she
are rare here he thought as Natsha readjusting a rose that was
slipping on her bodice settled herself beside him

When the cotillion was over the old count in his blue coat came up to
the dancers He invited Prince Andrew to come and see them and asked
his daughter whether she was enjoying herself Natsha did not answer at
once but only looked up with a smile that said reproachfully How can
you ask such a question

I have never enjoyed myself so much before she said and Prince
Andrew noticed how her thin arms rose quickly as if to embrace her
father and instantly dropped again Natsha was happier than she had
ever been in her life She was at that height of bliss when one becomes
completely kind and good and does not believe in the possibility of
evil unhappiness or sorrow

At that ball Pierre for the first time felt humiliated by the position
his wife occupied in court circles He was gloomy and absentminded A
deep furrow ran across his forehead and standing by a window he stared
over his spectacles seeing no one

On her way to supper Natsha passed him

Pierres gloomy unhappy look struck her She stopped in front of him
She wished to help him to bestow on him the superabundance of her own
happiness

How delightful it is Count said she Isnt it

Pierre smiled absentmindedly evidently not grasping what she said

Yes I am very glad he said

How can people be dissatisfied with anything thought Natsha
Especially such a capital fellow as Bezkhov In Natshas eyes all
the people at the ball alike were good kind and splendid people
loving one another none of them capable of injuring anotherand so they
ought all to be happy





CHAPTER XVIII

Next day Prince Andrew thought of the ball but his mind did not dwell
on it long Yes it was a very brilliant ball and then Yes that
little Rostva is very charming Theres something fresh original un
Petersburglike about her that distinguishes her That was all he
thought about yesterdays ball and after his morning tea he set to
work

But either from fatigue or want of sleep he was illdisposed for work
and could get nothing done He kept criticizing his own work as he
often did and was glad when he heard someone coming

The visitor was Bitski who served on various committees frequented all
the societies in Petersburg and a passionate devotee of the new ideas
and of Speranski and a diligent Petersburg newsmongerone of those men
who choose their opinions like their clothes according to the fashion
but who for that very reason appear to be the warmest partisans Hardly
had he got rid of his hat before he ran into Prince Andrews room with a
preoccupied air and at once began talking He had just heard particulars
of that mornings sitting of the Council of State opened by the Emperor
and he spoke of it enthusiastically The Emperors speech had been
extraordinary It had been a speech such as only constitutional monarchs
deliver The Sovereign plainly said that the Council and Senate are
estates of the realm he said that the government must rest not on
authority but on secure bases The Emperor said that the fiscal system
must be reorganized and the accounts published recounted Bitski
emphasizing certain words and opening his eyes significantly

Ah yes Todays events mark an epoch the greatest epoch in our
history he concluded

Prince Andrew listened to the account of the opening of the Council of
State which he had so impatiently awaited and to which he had attached
such importance and was surprised that this event now that it had
taken place did not affect him and even seemed quite insignificant He
listened with quiet irony to Bitskis enthusiastic account of it A very
simple thought occurred to him What does it matter to me or to Bitski
what the Emperor was pleased to say at the Council Can all that make me
any happier or better

And this simple reflection suddenly destroyed all the interest Prince
Andrew had felt in the impending reforms He was going to dine that
evening at Speranskis with only a few friends as the host had said
when inviting him The prospect of that dinner in the intimate home
circle of the man he so admired had greatly interested Prince Andrew
especially as he had not yet seen Speranski in his domestic
surroundings but now he felt disinclined to go to it

At the appointed hour however he entered the modest house Speranski
owned in the Taurida Gardens In the parqueted dining room this small
house remarkable for its extreme cleanliness suggesting that of a
monastery Prince Andrew who was rather late found the friendly
gathering of Speranskis intimate acquaintances already assembled at
five oclock There were no ladies present except Speranskis little
daughter longfaced like her father and her governess The other
guests were Gervais Magnitski and Stolypin While still in the
anteroom Prince Andrew heard loud voices and a ringing staccato laugha
laugh such as one hears on the stage Someoneit sounded like
Speranskiwas distinctly ejaculating hahaha Prince Andrew had never
before heard Speranskis famous laugh and this ringing highpitched
laughter from a statesman made a strange impression on him

He entered the dining room The whole company were standing between two
windows at a small table laid with horsdoeuvres Speranski wearing a
gray swallowtail coat with a star on the breast and evidently still
the same waistcoat and high white stock he had worn at the meeting of
the Council of State stood at the table with a beaming countenance His
guests surrounded him Magnitski addressing himself to Speranski was
relating an anecdote and Speranski was laughing in advance at what
Magnitski was going to say When Prince Andrew entered the room
Magnitskis words were again crowned by laughter Stolypin gave a deep
bass guffaw as he munched a piece of bread and cheese Gervais laughed
softly with a hissing chuckle and Speranski in a highpitched staccato
manner

Still laughing Speranski held out his soft white hand to Prince Andrew

Very pleased to see you Prince he said One moment he went on
turning to Magnitski and interrupting his story We have agreed that
this is a dinner for recreation with not a word about business and
turning again to the narrator he began to laugh afresh

Prince Andrew looked at the laughing Speranski with astonishment
regret and disillusionment It seemed to him that this was not
Speranski but someone else Everything that had formerly appeared
mysterious and fascinating in Speranski suddenly became plain and
unattractive

At dinner the conversation did not cease for a moment and seemed to
consist of the contents of a book of funny anecdotes Before Magnitski
had finished his story someone else was anxious to relate something
still funnier Most of the anecdotes if not relating to the state
service related to people in the service It seemed that in this
company the insignificance of those people was so definitely accepted
that the only possible attitude toward them was one of good humored
ridicule Speranski related how at the Council that morning a deaf
dignitary when asked his opinion replied that he thought so too
Gervais gave a long account of an official revision remarkable for the
stupidity of everybody concerned Stolypin stuttering broke into the
conversation and began excitedly talking of the abuses that existed
under the former order of thingsthreatening to give a serious turn to
the conversation Magnitski starting quizzing Stolypin about his
vehemence Gervais intervened with a joke and the talk reverted to its
former lively tone

Evidently Speranski liked to rest after his labors and find amusement in
a circle of friends and his guests understanding his wish tried to
enliven him and amuse themselves But their gaiety seemed to Prince
Andrew mirthless and tiresome Speranskis highpitched voice struck him
unpleasantly and the incessant laughter grated on him like a false
note Prince Andrew did not laugh and feared that he would be a damper
on the spirits of the company but no one took any notice of his being
out of harmony with the general mood They all seemed very gay

He tried several times to join in the conversation but his remarks were
tossed aside each time like a cork thrown out of the water and he could
not jest with them

There was nothing wrong or unseemly in what they said it was witty and
might have been funny but it lacked just that something which is the
salt of mirth and they were not even aware that such a thing existed

After dinner Speranskis daughter and her governess rose He patted the
little girl with his white hand and kissed her And that gesture too
seemed unnatural to Prince Andrew

The men remained at table over their portEnglish fashion In the midst
of a conversation that was started about Napoleons Spanish affairs
which they all agreed in approving Prince Andrew began to express a
contrary opinion Speranski smiled and with an evident wish to prevent
the conversation from taking an unpleasant course told a story that had
no connection with the previous conversation For a few moments all were
silent

Having sat some time at table Speranski corked a bottle of wine and
remarking Nowadays good wine rides in a carriage and pair passed it
to the servant and got up All rose and continuing to talk loudly went
into the drawing room Two letters brought by a courier were handed to
Speranski and he took them to his study As soon as he had left the room
the general merriment stopped and the guests began to converse sensibly
and quietly with one another

Now for the recitation said Speranski on returning from his study A
wonderful talent he said to Prince Andrew and Magnitski immediately
assumed a pose and began reciting some humorous verses in French which
he had composed about various wellknown Petersburg people He was
interrupted several times by applause When the verses were finished
Prince Andrew went up to Speranski and took his leave

Where are you off to so early asked Speranski

I promised to go to a reception

They said no more Prince Andrew looked closely into those mirrorlike
impenetrable eyes and felt that it had been ridiculous of him to have
expected anything from Speranski and from any of his own activities
connected with him or ever to have attributed importance to what
Speranski was doing That precise mirthless laughter rang in Prince
Andrews ears long after he had left the house

When he reached home Prince Andrew began thinking of his life in
Petersburg during those last four months as if it were something new He
recalled his exertions and solicitations and the history of his project
of army reform which had been accepted for consideration and which they
were trying to pass over in silence simply because another a very poor
one had already been prepared and submitted to the Emperor He thought
of the meetings of a committee of which Berg was a member He remembered
how carefully and at what length everything relating to form and
procedure was discussed at those meetings and how sedulously and
promptly all that related to the gist of the business was evaded He
recalled his labors on the Legal Code and how painstakingly he had
translated the articles of the Roman and French codes into Russian and
he felt ashamed of himself Then he vividly pictured to himself
Bogucharovo his occupations in the country his journey to Ryazan he
remembered the peasants and Dron the village elder and mentally
applying to them the Personal Rights he had divided into paragraphs he
felt astonished that he could have spent so much time on such useless
work





CHAPTER XIX

Next day Prince Andrew called at a few houses he had not visited before
and among them at the Rostvs with whom he had renewed acquaintance at
the ball Apart from considerations of politeness which demanded the
call he wanted to see that original eager girl who had left such a
pleasant impression on his mind in her own home

Natsha was one of the first to meet him She was wearing a darkblue
house dress in which Prince Andrew thought her even prettier than in her
ball dress She and all the Rostv family welcomed him as an old friend
simply and cordially The whole family whom he had formerly judged
severely now seemed to him to consist of excellent simple and kindly
people The old counts hospitality and good nature which struck one
especially in Petersburg as a pleasant surprise were such that Prince
Andrew could not refuse to stay to dinner Yes he thought they are
capital people who of course have not the slightest idea what a
treasure they possess in Natsha but they are kindly folk and form the
best possible setting for this strikingly poetic charming girl
overflowing with life

In Natsha Prince Andrew was conscious of a strange world completely
alien to him and brimful of joys unknown to him a different world that
in the Otradnoe avenue and at the window that moonlight night had
already begun to disconcert him Now this world disconcerted him no
longer and was no longer alien to him but he himself having entered it
found in it a new enjoyment

After dinner Natsha at Prince Andrews request went to the clavichord
and began singing Prince Andrew stood by a window talking to the ladies
and listened to her In the midst of a phrase he ceased speaking and
suddenly felt tears choking him a thing he had thought impossible for
him He looked at Natsha as she sang and something new and joyful
stirred in his soul He felt happy and at the same time sad He had
absolutely nothing to weep about yet he was ready to weep What about
His former love The little princess His disillusionments His hopes
for the future Yes and no The chief reason was a sudden vivid
sense of the terrible contrast between something infinitely great and
illimitable within him and that limited and material something that he
and even she was This contrast weighed on and yet cheered him while
she sang

As soon as Natsha had finished she went up to him and asked how he
liked her voice She asked this and then became confused feeling that
she ought not to have asked it He smiled looking at her and said he
liked her singing as he liked everything she did

Prince Andrew left the Rostvs late in the evening He went to bed from
habit but soon realized that he could not sleep Having lit his candle
he sat up in bed then got up then lay down again not at all troubled
by his sleeplessness his soul was as fresh and joyful as if he had
stepped out of a stuffy room into Gods own fresh air It did not enter
his head that he was in love with Natsha he was not thinking about
her but only picturing her to himself and in consequence all life
appeared in a new light Why do I strive why do I toil in this narrow
confined frame when life all life with all its joys is open to me
said he to himself And for the first time for a very long while he
began making happy plans for the future He decided that he must attend
to his sons education by finding a tutor and putting the boy in his
charge then he ought to retire from the service and go abroad and see
England Switzerland and Italy I must use my freedom while I feel so
much strength and youth in me he said to himself Pierre was right
when he said one must believe in the possibility of happiness in order
to be happy and now I do believe in it Let the dead bury their dead
but while one has life one must live and be happy thought he





CHAPTER XX

One morning Colonel Berg whom Pierre knew as he knew everybody in
Moscow and Petersburg came to see him Berg arrived in an immaculate
brandnew uniform with his hair pomaded and brushed forward over his
temples as the Emperor Alexander wore his hair

I have just been to see the countess your wife Unfortunately she
could not grant my request but I hope Count I shall be more fortunate
with you he said with a smile

What is it you wish Colonel I am at your service

I have now quite settled in my new rooms Count Berg said this with
perfect conviction that this information could not but be agreeable
and so I wish to arrange just a small party for my own and my wifes
friends He smiled still more pleasantly I wished to ask the
countess and you to do me the honor of coming to tea and to supper

Only Countess Hlne considering the society of such people as the
Bergs beneath her could be cruel enough to refuse such an invitation
Berg explained so clearly why he wanted to collect at his house a small
but select company and why this would give him pleasure and why though
he grudged spending money on cards or anything harmful he was prepared
to run into some expense for the sake of good societythat Pierre could
not refuse and promised to come

But dont be late Count if I may venture to ask about ten minutes to
eight please We shall make up a rubber Our general is coming He is
very good to me We shall have supper Count So you will do me the
favor

Contrary to his habit of being late Pierre on that day arrived at the
Bergs house not at ten but at fifteen minutes to eight

Having prepared everything necessary for the party the Bergs were ready
for their guests arrival

In their new clean and light study with its small busts and pictures
and new furniture sat Berg and his wife Berg closely buttoned up in
his new uniform sat beside his wife explaining to her that one always
could and should be acquainted with people above one because only then
does one get satisfaction from acquaintances

You can get to know something you can ask for something See how I
managed from my first promotion Berg measured his life not by years
but by promotions My comrades are still nobodies while I am only
waiting for a vacancy to command a regiment and have the happiness to
be your husband He rose and kissed Vras hand and on the way to her
straightened out a turnedup corner of the carpet And how have I
obtained all this Chiefly by knowing how to choose my aquaintances It
goes without saying that one must be conscientious and methodical

Berg smiled with a sense of his superiority over a weak woman and
paused reflecting that this dear wife of his was after all but a weak
woman who could not understand all that constitutes a mans dignity
what it was ein Mann zu sein Vra at the same time smiling with a
sense of superiority over her good conscientious husband who all the
same understood life wrongly as according to Vra all men did Berg
judging by his wife thought all women weak and foolish Vra judging
only by her husband and generalizing from that observation supposed
that all men though they understand nothing and are conceited and
selfish ascribe common sense to themselves alone

 To be a man

Berg rose and embraced his wife carefully so as not to crush her lace
fichu for which he had paid a good price kissing her straight on the
lips

The only thing is we mustnt have children too soon he continued
following an unconscious sequence of ideas

Yes answered Vra I dont at all want that We must live for
society

Princess Yusupova wore one exactly like this said Berg pointing to
the fichu with a happy and kindly smile

Just then Count Bezkhov was announced Husband and wife glanced at one
another both smiling with selfsatisfaction and each mentally claiming
the honor of this visit

This is what comes of knowing how to make acquaintances thought Berg
This is what comes of knowing how to conduct oneself

But please dont interrupt me when I am entertaining the guests said
Vra because I know what interests each of them and what to say to
different people

Berg smiled again

It cant be helped men must sometimes have masculine conversation
said he

They received Pierre in their small new drawing room where it was
impossible to sit down anywhere without disturbing its symmetry
neatness and order so it was quite comprehensible and not strange that
Berg having generously offered to disturb the symmetry of an armchair
or of the sofa for his dear guest but being apparently painfully
undecided on the matter himself eventually left the visitor to settle
the question of selection Pierre disturbed the symmetry by moving a
chair for himself and Berg and Vra immediately began their evening
party interrupting each other in their efforts to entertain their
guest

Vra having decided in her own mind that Pierre ought to be entertained
with conversation about the French embassy at once began accordingly
Berg having decided that masculine conversation was required
interrupted his wifes remarks and touched on the question of the war
with Austria and unconsciously jumped from the general subject to
personal considerations as to the proposals made him to take part in the
Austrian campaign and the reasons why he had declined them Though the
conversation was very incoherent and Vra was angry at the intrusion of
the masculine element both husband and wife felt with satisfaction
that even if only one guest was present their evening had begun very
well and was as like as two peas to every other evening party with its
talk tea and lighted candles

Before long Bors Bergs old comrade arrived There was a shade of
condescension and patronage in his treatment of Berg and Vra After
Bors came a lady with the colonel then the general himself then the
Rostvs and the party became unquestionably exactly like all other
evening parties Berg and Vra could not repress their smiles of
satisfaction at the sight of all this movement in their drawing room at
the sound of the disconnected talk the rustling of dresses and the
bowing and scraping Everything was just as everybody always has it
especially so the general who admired the apartment patted Berg on the
shoulder and with parental authority superintended the setting out of
the table for boston The general sat down by Count Ily Rostv who was
next to himself the most important guest The old people sat with the
old the young with the young and the hostess at the tea table on
which stood exactly the same kind of cakes in a silver cake basket as
the Panins had at their party Everything was just as it was everywhere
else





CHAPTER XXI

Pierre as one of the principal guests had to sit down to boston with
Count Rostv the general and the colonel At the card table he
happened to be directly facing Natsha and was struck by a curious
change that had come over her since the ball She was silent and not
only less pretty than at the ball but only redeemed from plainness by
her look of gentle indifference to everything around

Whats the matter with her thought Pierre glancing at her She was
sitting by her sister at the tea table and reluctantly without looking
at him made some reply to Bors who sat down beside her After playing
out a whole suit and to his partners delight taking five tricks
Pierre hearing greetings and the steps of someone who had entered the
room while he was picking up his tricks glanced again at Natsha

What has happened to her he asked himself with still greater
surprise

Prince Andrew was standing before her saying something to her with a
look of tender solicitude She having raised her head was looking up
at him flushed and evidently trying to master her rapid breathing And
the bright glow of some inner fire that had been suppressed was again
alight in her She was completely transformed and from a plain girl had
again become what she had been at the ball

Prince Andrew went up to Pierre and the latter noticed a new and
youthful expression in his friends face

Pierre changed places several times during the game sitting now with
his back to Natsha and now facing her but during the whole of the six
rubbers he watched her and his friend

Something very important is happening between them thought Pierre
and a feeling that was both joyful and painful agitated him and made him
neglect the game

After six rubbers the general got up saying that it was no use playing
like that and Pierre was released Natsha on one side was talking with
Snya and Bors and Vra with a subtle smile was saying something to
Prince Andrew Pierre went up to his friend and asking whether they
were talking secrets sat down beside them Vra having noticed Prince
Andrews attentions to Natsha decided that at a party a real evening
party subtle allusions to the tender passion were absolutely necessary
and seizing a moment when Prince Andrew was alone began a conversation
with him about feelings in general and about her sister With so
intellectual a guest as she considered Prince Andrew to be she felt
that she had to employ her diplomatic tact

When Pierre went up to them he noticed that Vra was being carried away
by her selfsatisfied talk but that Prince Andrew seemed embarrassed a
thing that rarely happened with him

What do you think Vra was saying with an arch smile You are so
discerning Prince and understand peoples characters so well at a
glance What do you think of Natalie Could she be constant in her
attachments Could she like other women Vra meant herself love a
man once for all and remain true to him forever That is what I consider
true love What do you think Prince

I know your sister too little replied Prince Andrew with a sarcastic
smile under which he wished to hide his embarrassment to be able to
solve so delicate a question and then I have noticed that the less
attractive a woman is the more constant she is likely to be he added
and looked up at Pierre who was just approaching them

Yes that is true Prince In our days continued Vramentioning our
days as people of limited intelligence are fond of doing imagining
that they have discovered and appraised the peculiarities of our days
and that human characteristics change with the timesin our days a girl
has so much freedom that the pleasure of being courted often stifles
real feeling in her And it must be confessed that Natalie is very
susceptible This return to the subject of Natalie caused Prince Andrew
to knit his brows with discomfort he was about to rise but Vra
continued with a still more subtle smile

I think no one has been more courted than she she went on but till
quite lately she never cared seriously for anyone Now you know Count
she said to Pierre even our dear cousin Bors who between ourselves
was very far gone in the land of tenderness alluding to a map of
love much in vogue at that time

Prince Andrew frowned and remained silent

You are friendly with Bors arent you asked Vra

Yes I know him

I expect he has told you of his childish love for Natsha

Oh there was childish love suddenly asked Prince Andrew blushing
unexpectedly

Yes you know between cousins intimacy often leads to love Le
cousinage est un dangereux voisinage Dont you think so

 Cousinhood is a dangerous neighborhood

Oh undoubtedly said Prince Andrew and with sudden and unnatural
liveliness he began chaffing Pierre about the need to be very careful
with his fiftyyearold Moscow cousins and in the midst of these
jesting remarks he rose taking Pierre by the arm and drew him aside

Well asked Pierre seeing his friends strange animation with
surprise and noticing the glance he turned on Natsha as he rose

I must I must have a talk with you said Prince Andrew You know
that pair of womens gloves He referred to the masonic gloves given
to a newly initiated Brother to present to the woman he loved I
but no I will talk to you later on and with a strange light in his
eyes and restlessness in his movements Prince Andrew approached Natsha
and sat down beside her Pierre saw how Prince Andrew asked her
something and how she flushed as she replied

But at that moment Berg came to Pierre and began insisting that he
should take part in an argument between the general and the colonel on
the affairs in Spain

Berg was satisfied and happy The smile of pleasure never left his face
The party was very successful and quite like other parties he had seen
Everything was similar the ladies subtle talk the cards the general
raising his voice at the card table and the samovar and the tea cakes
only one thing was lacking that he had always seen at the evening
parties he wished to imitate They had not yet had a loud conversation
among the men and a dispute about something important and clever Now
the general had begun such a discussion and so Berg drew Pierre to it





CHAPTER XXII

Next day having been invited by the count Prince Andrew dined with the
Rostvs and spent the rest of the day there

Everyone in the house realized for whose sake Prince Andrew came and
without concealing it he tried to be with Natsha all day Not only in
the soul of the frightened yet happy and enraptured Natsha but in the
whole house there was a feeling of awe at something important that was
bound to happen The countess looked with sad and sternly serious eyes
at Prince Andrew when he talked to Natsha and timidly started some
artificial conversation about trifles as soon as he looked her way
Snya was afraid to leave Natsha and afraid of being in the way when
she was with them Natsha grew pale in a panic of expectation when
she remained alone with him for a moment Prince Andrew surprised her by
his timidity She felt that he wanted to say something to her but could
not bring himself to do so

In the evening when Prince Andrew had left the countess went up to
Natsha and whispered Well what

Mamma For heavens sake dont ask me anything now One cant talk
about that said Natsha

But all the same that night Natsha now agitated and now frightened
lay a long time in her mothers bed gazing straight before her She told
her how he had complimented her how he told her he was going abroad
asked her where they were going to spend the summer and then how he had
asked her about Bors

But such a such a never happened to me before she said Only I
feel afraid in his presence I am always afraid when Im with him What
does that mean Does it mean that its the real thing Yes Mamma are
you asleep

No my love I am frightened myself answered her mother Now go

All the same I shant sleep What silliness to sleep Mummy Mummy
such a thing never happened to me before she said surprised and
alarmed at the feeling she was aware of in herself And could we ever
have thought

It seemed to Natsha that even at the time she first saw Prince Andrew
at Otradnoe she had fallen in love with him It was as if she feared
this strange unexpected happiness of meeting again the very man she had
then chosen she was firmly convinced she had done so and of finding
him as it seemed not indifferent to her

And it had to happen that he should come specially to Petersburg while
we are here And it had to happen that we should meet at that ball It
is fate Clearly it is fate that everything led up to this Already
then directly I saw him I felt something peculiar

What else did he say to you What are those verses Read them said
her mother thoughtfully referring to some verses Prince Andrew had
written in Natshas album

Mamma one need not be ashamed of his being a widower

Dont Natsha Pray to God Marriages are made in heaven said her
mother

Darling Mummy how I love you How happy I am cried Natsha shedding
tears of joy and excitement and embracing her mother

At that very time Prince Andrew was sitting with Pierre and telling him
of his love for Natsha and his firm resolve to make her his wife

That day Countess Hlne had a reception at her house The French
ambassador was there and a foreign prince of the blood who had of late
become a frequent visitor of hers and many brilliant ladies and
gentlemen Pierre who had come downstairs walked through the rooms and
struck everyone by his preoccupied absentminded and morose air

Since the ball he had felt the approach of a fit of nervous depression
and had made desperate efforts to combat it Since the intimacy of his
wife with the royal prince Pierre had unexpectedly been made a
gentleman of the bedchamber and from that time he had begun to feel
oppressed and ashamed in court society and dark thoughts of the vanity
of all things human came to him oftener than before At the same time
the feeling he had noticed between his protegee Natsha and Prince
Andrew accentuated his gloom by the contrast between his own position
and his friends He tried equally to avoid thinking about his wife and
about Natsha and Prince Andrew and again everything seemed to him
insignificant in comparison with eternity again the question for what
presented itself and he forced himself to work day and night at masonic
labors hoping to drive away the evil spirit that threatened him Toward
midnight after he had left the countess apartments he was sitting
upstairs in a shabby dressing gown copying out the original transaction
of the Scottish lodge of Freemasons at a table in his low room cloudy
with tobacco smoke when someone came in It was Prince Andrew

Ah its you said Pierre with a preoccupied dissatisfied air And
I you see am hard at it He pointed to his manuscript book with that
air of escaping from the ills of life with which unhappy people look at
their work

Prince Andrew with a beaming ecstatic expression of renewed life on
his face paused in front of Pierre and not noticing his sad look
smiled at him with the egotism of joy

Well dear heart said he I wanted to tell you about it yesterday
and I have come to do so today I never experienced anything like it
before I am in love my friend

Suddenly Pierre heaved a deep sigh and dumped his heavy person down on
the sofa beside Prince Andrew

With Natsha Rostva yes said he

Yes yes Who else should it be I should never have believed it but
the feeling is stronger than I Yesterday I tormented myself and
suffered but I would not exchange even that torment for anything in the
world I have not lived till now At last I live but I cant live
without her But can she love me I am too old for her Why dont
you speak

I I What did I tell you said Pierre suddenly rising and beginning
to pace up and down the room I always thought it That girl is such
a treasure she is a rare girl My dear friend I entreat you
dont philosophize dont doubt marry marry marry And I am sure
there will not be a happier man than you

But what of her

She loves you

Dont talk rubbish said Prince Andrew smiling and looking into
Pierres eyes

She does I know Pierre cried fiercely

But do listen returned Prince Andrew holding him by the arm Do you
know the condition I am in I must talk about it to someone

Well go on go on I am very glad said Pierre and his face really
changed his brow became smooth and he listened gladly to Prince
Andrew Prince Andrew seemed and really was quite a different quite a
new man Where was his spleen his contempt for life his
disillusionment Pierre was the only person to whom he made up his mind
to speak openly and to him he told all that was in his soul Now he
boldly and lightly made plans for an extended future said he could not
sacrifice his own happiness to his fathers caprice and spoke of how he
would either make his father consent to this marriage and love her or
would do without his consent then he marveled at the feeling that had
mastered him as at something strange apart from and independent of
himself

I should not have believed anyone who told me that I was capable of
such love said Prince Andrew It is not at all the same feeling that
I knew in the past The whole world is now for me divided into two
halves one half is she and there all is joy hope light the other
half is everything where she is not and there is all gloom and
darkness

Darkness and gloom reiterated Pierre yes yes I understand that

I cannot help loving the light it is not my fault And I am very
happy You understand me I know you are glad for my sake

Yes yes Pierre assented looking at his friend with a touched and
sad expression in his eyes The brighter Prince Andrews lot appeared to
him the gloomier seemed his own





CHAPTER XXIII

Prince Andrew needed his fathers consent to his marriage and to obtain
this he started for the country next day

His father received his sons communication with external composure but
inward wrath He could not comprehend how anyone could wish to alter his
life or introduce anything new into it when his own life was already
ending If only they would let me end my days as I want to thought
the old man then they might do as they please With his son however
he employed the diplomacy he reserved for important occasions and
adopting a quiet tone discussed the whole matter

In the first place the marriage was not a brilliant one as regards
birth wealth or rank Secondly Prince Andrew was no longer as young
as he had been and his health was poor the old man laid special stress
on this while she was very young Thirdly he had a son whom it would
be a pity to entrust to a chit of a girl Fourthly and finally the
father said looking ironically at his son I beg you to put it off for
a year go abroad take a cure look out as you wanted to for a German
tutor for Prince Nicholas Then if your love or passion or obstinacyas
you pleaseis still as great marry And thats my last word on it
Mind the last concluded the prince in a tone which showed that
nothing would make him alter his decision

Prince Andrew saw clearly that the old man hoped that his feelings or
his fiancees would not stand a years test or that he the old prince
himself would die before then and he decided to conform to his
fathers wishto propose and postpone the wedding for a year

Three weeks after the last evening he had spent with the Rostvs Prince
Andrew returned to Petersburg

Next day after her talk with her mother Natsha expected Bolknski all
day but he did not come On the second and third day it was the same
Pierre did not come either and Natsha not knowing that Prince Andrew
had gone to see his father could not explain his absence to herself

Three weeks passed in this way Natsha had no desire to go out anywhere
and wandered from room to room like a shadow idle and listless she
wept secretly at night and did not go to her mother in the evenings She
blushed continually and was irritable It seemed to her that everybody
knew about her disappointment and was laughing at her and pitying her
Strong as was her inward grief this wound to her vanity intensified her
misery

Once she came to her mother tried to say something and suddenly began
to cry Her tears were those of an offended child who does not know why
it is being punished

The countess began to soothe Natsha who after first listening to her
mothers words suddenly interrupted her

Leave off Mamma I dont think and dont want to think about it He
just came and then left off left off

Her voice trembled and she again nearly cried but recovered and went
on quietly

And I dont at all want to get married And I am afraid of him I have
now become quite calm quite calm

The day after this conversation Natsha put on the old dress which she
knew had the peculiar property of conducing to cheerfulness in the
mornings and that day she returned to the old way of life which she had
abandoned since the ball Having finished her morning tea she went to
the ballroom which she particularly liked for its loud resonance and
began singing her solfeggio When she had finished her first exercise
she stood still in the middle of the room and sang a musical phrase that
particularly pleased her She listened joyfully as though she had not
expected it to the charm of the notes reverberating filling the whole
empty ballroom and slowly dying away and all at once she felt
cheerful Whats the good of making so much of it Things are nice as
it is she said to herself and she began walking up and down the room
not stepping simply on the resounding parquet but treading with each
step from the heel to the toe she had on a new and favorite pair of
shoes and listening to the regular tap of the heel and creak of the toe
as gladly as she had to the sounds of her own voice Passing a mirror
she glanced into it There thats me the expression of her face
seemed to say as she caught sight of herself Well and very nice too
I need nobody

A footman wanted to come in to clear away something in the room but she
would not let him and having closed the door behind him continued her
walk That morning she had returned to her favorite moodlove of and
delight in herself How charming that Natsha is she said again
speaking as some third collective male person Pretty a good voice
young and in nobodys way if only they leave her in peace But however
much they left her in peace she could not now be at peace and
immediately felt this

In the hall the porch door opened and someone asked At home and
then footsteps were heard Natsha was looking at the mirror but did
not see herself She listened to the sounds in the hall When she saw
herself her face was pale It was he She knew this for certain though
she hardly heard his voice through the closed doors

Pale and agitated Natsha ran into the drawing room

Mamma Bolknski has come she said Mamma it is awful it is
unbearable I dont want to be tormented What am I to do

Before the countess could answer Prince Andrew entered the room with an
agitated and serious face As soon as he saw Natsha his face
brightened He kissed the countess hand and Natshas and sat down
beside the sofa

It is long since we had the pleasure began the countess but Prince
Andrew interrupted her by answering her intended question obviously in
haste to say what he had to

I have not been to see you all this time because I have been at my
fathers I had to talk over a very important matter with him I only
got back last night he said glancing at Natsha I want to have a
talk with you Countess he added after a moments pause

The countess lowered her eyes sighing deeply

I am at your disposal she murmured

Natsha knew that she ought to go away but was unable to do so
something gripped her throat and regardless of manners she stared
straight at Prince Andrew with wideopen eyes

At once This instant No it cant be she thought

Again he glanced at her and that glance convinced her that she was not
mistaken Yes at once that very instant her fate would be decided

Go Natsha I will call you said the countess in a whisper

Natsha glanced with frightened imploring eyes at Prince Andrew and at
her mother and went out

I have come Countess to ask for your daughters hand said Prince
Andrew

The countess face flushed hotly but she said nothing

Your offer she began at last sedately He remained silent looking
into her eyes Your offer she grew confused is agreeable to us
and I accept your offer I am glad And my husband I hope but it
will depend on her

I will speak to her when I have your consent Do you give it to me
said Prince Andrew

Yes replied the countess She held out her hand to him and with a
mixed feeling of estrangement and tenderness pressed her lips to his
forehead as he stooped to kiss her hand She wished to love him as a
son but felt that to her he was a stranger and a terrifying man I am
sure my husband will consent said the countess but your father

My father to whom I have told my plans has made it an express
condition of his consent that the wedding is not to take place for a
year And I wished to tell you of that said Prince Andrew

It is true that Natsha is still young butso long as that

It is unavoidable said Prince Andrew with a sigh

I will send her to you said the countess and left the room

Lord have mercy upon us she repeated while seeking her daughter

Snya said that Natsha was in her bedroom Natsha was sitting on the
bed pale and dry eyed and was gazing at the icons and whispering
something as she rapidly crossed herself Seeing her mother she jumped
up and flew to her

Well Mamma Well

Go go to him He is asking for your hand said the countess coldly
it seemed to Natsha Go go said the mother sadly and
reproachfully with a deep sigh as her daughter ran away

Natsha never remembered how she entered the drawing room When she came
in and saw him she paused Is it possible that this stranger has now
become everything to me she asked herself and immediately answered
Yes everything He alone is now dearer to me than everything in the
world Prince Andrew came up to her with downcast eyes

I have loved you from the very first moment I saw you May I hope

He looked at her and was struck by the serious impassioned expression of
her face Her face said Why ask Why doubt what you cannot but know
Why speak when words cannot express what one feels

She drew near to him and stopped He took her hand and kissed it

Do you love me

Yes yes Natsha murmured as if in vexation Then she sighed loudly
and catching her breath more and more quickly began to sob

What is it Whats the matter

Oh I am so happy she replied smiled through her tears bent over
closer to him paused for an instant as if asking herself whether she
might and then kissed him

Prince Andrew held her hands looked into her eyes and did not find in
his heart his former love for her Something in him had suddenly
changed there was no longer the former poetic and mystic charm of
desire but there was pity for her feminine and childish weakness fear
at her devotion and trustfulness and an oppressive yet joyful sense of
the duty that now bound him to her forever The present feeling though
not so bright and poetic as the former was stronger and more serious

Did your mother tell you that it cannot be for a year asked Prince
Andrew still looking into her eyes

Is it possible that Ithe chit of a girl as everybody called me
thought Natshais it possible that I am now to be the wife and the
equal of this strange dear clever man whom even my father looks up to
Can it be true Can it be true that there can be no more playing with
life that now I am grown up that on me now lies a responsibility for
my every word and deed Yes but what did he ask me

No she replied but she had not understood his question

Forgive me he said But you are so young and I have already been
through so much in life I am afraid for you you do not yet know
yourself

Natsha listened with concentrated attention trying but failing to take
in the meaning of his words

Hard as this year which delays my happiness will be continued Prince
Andrew it will give you time to be sure of yourself I ask you to make
me happy in a year but you are free our engagement shall remain a
secret and should you find that you do not love me or should you come
to love said Prince Andrew with an unnatural smile

Why do you say that Natsha interrupted him You know that from the
very day you first came to Otradnoe I have loved you she cried quite
convinced that she spoke the truth

In a year you will learn to know yourself

A whole year Natsha repeated suddenly only now realizing that the
marriage was to be postponed for a year But why a year Why a
year

Prince Andrew began to explain to her the reasons for this delay
Natsha did not hear him

And cant it be helped she asked Prince Andrew did not reply but
his face expressed the impossibility of altering that decision

Its awful Oh its awful awful Natsha suddenly cried and again
burst into sobs I shall die waiting a year its impossible its
awful She looked into her lovers face and saw in it a look of
commiseration and perplexity

No no Ill do anything she said suddenly checking her tears I am
so happy

The father and mother came into the room and gave the betrothed couple
their blessing

From that day Prince Andrew began to frequent the Rostvs as Natshas
affianced lover





CHAPTER XXIV

No betrothal ceremony took place and Natshas engagement to Bolknski
was not announced Prince Andrew insisted on that He said that as he
was responsible for the delay he ought to bear the whole burden of it
that he had given his word and bound himself forever but that he did
not wish to bind Natsha and gave her perfect freedom If after six
months she felt that she did not love him she would have full right to
reject him Naturally neither Natsha nor her parents wished to hear of
this but Prince Andrew was firm He came every day to the Rostvs but
did not behave to Natsha as an affianced lover he did not use the
familiar thou but said you to her and kissed only her hand After
their engagement quite different intimate and natural relations
sprang up between them It was as if they had not known each other till
now Both liked to recall how they had regarded each other when as yet
they were nothing to one another they felt themselves now quite
different beings then they were artificial now natural and sincere At
first the family felt some constraint in intercourse with Prince Andrew
he seemed a man from another world and for a long time Natsha trained
the family to get used to him proudly assuring them all that he only
appeared to be different but was really just like all of them and that
she was not afraid of him and no one else ought to be After a few days
they grew accustomed to him and without restraint in his presence
pursued their usual way of life in which he took his part He could
talk about rural economy with the count fashions with the countess and
Natsha and about albums and fancywork with Snya Sometimes the
household both among themselves and in his presence expressed their
wonder at how it had all happened and at the evident omens there had
been of it Prince Andrews coming to Otradnoe and their coming to
Petersburg and the likeness between Natsha and Prince Andrew which her
nurse had noticed on his first visit and Andrews encounter with
Nicholas in 1805 and many other incidents betokening that it had to be

In the house that poetic dullness and quiet reigned which always
accompanies the presence of a betrothed couple Often when all sitting
together everyone kept silent Sometimes the others would get up and go
away and the couple left alone still remained silent They rarely
spoke of their future life Prince Andrew was afraid and ashamed to
speak of it Natsha shared this as she did all his feelings which she
constantly divined Once she began questioning him about his son Prince
Andrew blushed as he often did nowNatsha particularly liked it in
himand said that his son would not live with them

Why not asked Natsha in a frightened tone

I cannot take him away from his grandfather and besides

How I should have loved him said Natsha immediately guessing his
thought but I know you wish to avoid any pretext for finding fault
with us

Sometimes the old count would come up kiss Prince Andrew and ask his
advice about Ptyas education or Nicholas service The old countess
sighed as she looked at them Snya was always getting frightened lest
she should be in the way and tried to find excuses for leaving them
alone even when they did not wish it When Prince Andrew spoke he
could tell a story very well Natsha listened to him with pride when
she spoke she noticed with fear and joy that he gazed attentively and
scrutinizingly at her She asked herself in perplexity What does he
look for in me He is trying to discover something by looking at me
What if what he seeks in me is not there Sometimes she fell into one
of the mad merry moods characteristic of her and then she particularly
loved to hear and see how Prince Andrew laughed He seldom laughed but
when he did he abandoned himself entirely to his laughter and after
such a laugh she always felt nearer to him Natsha would have been
completely happy if the thought of the separation awaiting her and
drawing near had not terrified her just as the mere thought of it made
him turn pale and cold

On the eve of his departure from Petersburg Prince Andrew brought with
him Pierre who had not been to the Rostvs once since the ball Pierre
seemed disconcerted and embarrassed He was talking to the countess and
Natsha sat down beside a little chess table with Snya thereby
inviting Prince Andrew to come too He did so

You have known Bezkhov a long time he asked Do you like him

Yes hes a dear but very absurd

And as usual when speaking of Pierre she began to tell anecdotes of his
absentmindedness some of which had even been invented about him

Do you know I have entrusted him with our secret I have known him from
childhood He has a heart of gold I beg you Natalie Prince Andrew
said with sudden seriousnessI am going away and heaven knows what may
happen You may cease to all right I know I am not to say that Only
this then whatever may happen to you when I am not here

What can happen

Whatever trouble may come Prince Andrew continued I beg you
Mademoiselle Sophie whatever may happen to turn to him alone for
advice and help He is a most absentminded and absurd fellow but he
has a heart of gold

Neither her father nor her mother nor Snya nor Prince Andrew himself
could have foreseen how the separation from her lover would act on
Natsha Flushed and agitated she went about the house all that day
dryeyed occupied with most trivial matters as if not understanding
what awaited her She did not even cry when on taking leave he kissed
her hand for the last time Dont go she said in a tone that made him
wonder whether he really ought not to stay and which he remembered long
afterwards Nor did she cry when he was gone but for several days she
sat in her room dryeyed taking no interest in anything and only saying
now and then Oh why did he go away

But a fortnight after his departure to the surprise of those around
her she recovered from her mental sickness just as suddenly and became
her old self again but with a change in her moral physiognomy as a
child gets up after a long illness with a changed expression of face





CHAPTER XXV

During that year after his sons departure Prince Nicholas Bolknskis
health and temper became much worse He grew still more irritable and
it was Princess Mary who generally bore the brunt of his frequent fits
of unprovoked anger He seemed carefully to seek out her tender spots so
as to torture her mentally as harshly as possible Princess Mary had two
passions and consequently two joysher nephew little Nicholas and
religionand these were the favorite subjects of the princes attacks
and ridicule Whatever was spoken of he would bring round to the
superstitiousness of old maids or the petting and spoiling of children
You want to make himlittle Nicholasinto an old maid like yourself
A pity Prince Andrew wants a son and not an old maid he would say
Or turning to Mademoiselle Bourienne he would ask her in Princess
Marys presence how she liked our village priests and icons and would
joke about them

He continually hurt Princess Marys feelings and tormented her but it
cost her no effort to forgive him Could he be to blame toward her or
could her father whom she knew loved her in spite of it all be unjust
And what is justice The princess never thought of that proud word
justice All the complex laws of man centered for her in one clear and
simple lawthe law of love and selfsacrifice taught us by Him who
lovingly suffered for mankind though He Himself was God What had she to
do with the justice or injustice of other people She had to endure and
love and that she did

During the winter Prince Andrew had come to Bald Hills and had been gay
gentle and more affectionate than Princess Mary had known him for a
long time past She felt that something had happened to him but he said
nothing to her about his love Before he left he had a long talk with
his father about something and Princess Mary noticed that before his
departure they were dissatisfied with one another

Soon after Prince Andrew had gone Princess Mary wrote to her friend
Julie Kargina in Petersburg whom she had dreamed as all girls dream
of marrying to her brother and who was at that time in mourning for her
own brother killed in Turkey

Sorrow it seems is our common lot my dear tender friend Julie

Your loss is so terrible that I can only explain it to myself as a
special providence of God who loving you wishes to try you and your
excellent mother Oh my friend Religion and religion alone canI
will not say comfort usbut save us from despair Religion alone can
explain to us what without its help man cannot comprehend why for what
cause kind and noble beings able to find happiness in lifenot merely
harming no one but necessary to the happiness of othersare called away
to God while cruel useless harmful persons or such as are a burden
to themselves and to others are left living The first death I saw and
one I shall never forgetthat of my dear sisterinlawleft that
impression on me Just as you ask destiny why your splendid brother had
to die so I asked why that angel Lise who not only never wronged
anyone but in whose soul there were never any unkind thoughts had to
die And what do you think dear friend Five years have passed since
then and already I with my petty understanding begin to see clearly
why she had to die and in what way that death was but an expression of
the infinite goodness of the Creator whose every action though
generally incomprehensible to us is but a manifestation of His infinite
love for His creatures Perhaps I often think she was too angelically
innocent to have the strength to perform all a mothers duties As a
young wife she was irreproachable perhaps she could not have been so as
a mother As it is not only has she left us and particularly Prince
Andrew with the purest regrets and memories but probably she will
there receive a place I dare not hope for myself But not to speak of
her alone that early and terrible death has had the most beneficent
influence on me and on my brother in spite of all our grief Then at
the moment of our loss these thoughts could not occur to me I should
then have dismissed them with horror but now they are very clear and
certain I write all this to you dear friend only to convince you of
the Gospel truth which has become for me a principle of life not a
single hair of our heads will fall without His will And His will is
governed only by infinite love for us and so whatever befalls us is for
our good

You ask whether we shall spend next winter in Moscow In spite of my
wish to see you I do not think so and do not want to do so You will be
surprised to hear that the reason for this is Buonaparte The case is
this my fathers health is growing noticeably worse he cannot stand
any contradiction and is becoming irritable This irritability is as
you know chiefly directed to political questions He cannot endure the
notion that Buonaparte is negotiating on equal terms with all the
sovereigns of Europe and particularly with our own the grandson of the
Great Catherine As you know I am quite indifferent to politics but
from my fathers remarks and his talks with Michael Ivnovich I know all
that goes on in the world and especially about the honors conferred on
Buonaparte who only at Bald Hills in the whole world it seems is not
accepted as a great man still less as Emperor of France And my father
cannot stand this It seems to me that it is chiefly because of his
political views that my father is reluctant to speak of going to Moscow
for he foresees the encounters that would result from his way of
expressing his views regardless of anybody All the benefit he might
derive from a course of treatment he would lose as a result of the
disputes about Buonaparte which would be inevitable In any case it will
be decided very shortly

Our family life goes on in the old way except for my brother Andrews
absence He as I wrote you before has changed very much of late After
his sorrow he only this year quite recovered his spirits He has again
become as I used to know him when a child kind affectionate with that
heart of gold to which I know no equal He has realized it seems to me
that life is not over for him But together with this mental change he
has grown physically much weaker He has become thinner and more
nervous I am anxious about him and glad he is taking this trip abroad
which the doctors recommended long ago I hope it will cure him You
write that in Petersburg he is spoken of as one of the most active
cultivated and capable of the young men Forgive my vanity as a
relation but I never doubted it The good he has done to everybody
here from his peasants up to the gentry is incalculable On his
arrival in Petersburg he received only his due I always wonder at the
way rumors fly from Petersburg to Moscow especially such false ones as
that you write aboutI mean the report of my brothers betrothal to the
little Rostva I do not think my brother will ever marry again and
certainly not her and this is why first I know that though he rarely
speaks about the wife he has lost the grief of that loss has gone too
deep in his heart for him ever to decide to give her a successor and our
little angel a stepmother Secondly because as far as I know that girl
is not the kind of girl who could please Prince Andrew I do not think
he would choose her for a wife and frankly I do not wish it But I am
running on too long and am at the end of my second sheet Goodbye my
dear friend May God keep you in His holy and mighty care My dear
friend Mademoiselle Bourienne sends you kisses

MARY




CHAPTER XXVI

In the middle of the summer Princess Mary received an unexpected letter
from Prince Andrew in Switzerland in which he gave her strange and
surprising news He informed her of his engagement to Natsha Rostva
The whole letter breathed loving rapture for his betrothed and tender
and confiding affection for his sister He wrote that he had never loved
as he did now and that only now did he understand and know what life
was He asked his sister to forgive him for not having told her of his
resolve when he had last visited Bald Hills though he had spoken of it
to his father He had not done so for fear Princess Mary should ask her
father to give his consent irritating him and having to bear the brunt
of his displeasure without attaining her object Besides he wrote
the matter was not then so definitely settled as it is now My father
then insisted on a delay of a year and now already six months half of
that period have passed and my resolution is firmer than ever If the
doctors did not keep me here at the spas I should be back in Russia but
as it is I have to postpone my return for three months You know me and
my relations with Father I want nothing from him I have been and
always shall be independent but to go against his will and arouse his
anger now that he may perhaps remain with us such a short time would
destroy half my happiness I am now writing to him about the same
question and beg you to choose a good moment to hand him the letter and
to let me know how he looks at the whole matter and whether there is
hope that he may consent to reduce the term by four months

After long hesitations doubts and prayers Princess Mary gave the
letter to her father The next day the old prince said to her quietly

Write and tell your brother to wait till I am dead It wont be
longI shall soon set him free

The princess was about to reply but her father would not let her speak
and raising his voice more and more cried

Marry marry my boy A good family Clever people eh Rich eh
Yes a nice stepmother little Nicholas will have Write and tell him
that he may marry tomorrow if he likes She will be little Nicholas
stepmother and Ill marry Bourienne Ha ha ha He mustnt be
without a stepmother either Only one thing no more women are wanted in
my houselet him marry and live by himself Perhaps you will go and live
with him too he added turning to Princess Mary Go in heavens name
Go out into the frost the frost the frost

After this outburst the prince did not speak any more about the matter
But repressed vexation at his sons poorspirited behavior found
expression in his treatment of his daughter To his former pretexts for
irony a fresh one was now addedallusions to stepmothers and
amiabilities to Mademoiselle Bourienne

Why shouldnt I marry her he asked his daughter Shell make a
splendid princess

And latterly to her surprise and bewilderment Princess Mary noticed
that her father was really associating more and more with the
Frenchwoman She wrote to Prince Andrew about the reception of his
letter but comforted him with hopes of reconciling their father to the
idea

Little Nicholas and his education her brother Andrew and religion were
Princess Marys joys and consolations but besides that since everyone
must have personal hopes Princess Mary in the profoundest depths of her
heart had a hidden dream and hope that supplied the chief consolation of
her life This comforting dream and hope were given her by Gods
folkthe halfwitted and other pilgrims who visited her without the
princes knowledge The longer she lived the more experience and
observation she had of life the greater was her wonder at the short
sightedness of men who seek enjoyment and happiness here on earth
toiling suffering struggling and harming one another to obtain that
impossible visionary sinful happiness Prince Andrew had loved his
wife she died but that was not enough he wanted to bind his happiness
to another woman Her father objected to this because he wanted a more
distinguished and wealthier match for Andrew And they all struggled and
suffered and tormented one another and injured their souls their
eternal souls for the attainment of benefits which endure but for an
instant Not only do we know this ourselves but Christ the Son of God
came down to earth and told us that this life is but for a moment and is
a probation yet we cling to it and think to find happiness in it How
is it that no one realizes this thought Princess Mary No one except
these despised Gods folk who wallet on back come to me by the back
door afraid of being seen by the prince not for fear of illusage by
him but for fear of causing him to sin To leave family home and all
the cares of worldly welfare in order without clinging to anything to
wander in hempen rags from place to place under an assumed name doing
no one any harm but praying for allfor those who drive one away as well
as for those who protect one higher than that life and truth there is
no life or truth

There was one pilgrim a quiet pockmarked little woman of fifty called
Theodosia who for over thirty years had gone about barefoot and worn
heavy chains Princess Mary was particularly fond of her Once when in
a room with a lamp dimly lit before the icon Theodosia was talking of
her life the thought that Theodosia alone had found the true path of
life suddenly came to Princess Mary with such force that she resolved to
become a pilgrim herself When Theodosia had gone to sleep Princess Mary
thought about this for a long time and at last made up her mind that
strange as it might seem she must go on a pilgrimage She disclosed
this thought to no one but to her confessor Father Akinfi the monk
and he approved of her intention Under guise of a present for the
pilgrims Princess Mary prepared a pilgrims complete costume for
herself a coarse smock bast shoes a rough coat and a black kerchief
Often approaching the chest of drawers containing this secret treasure
Princess Mary paused uncertain whether the time had not already come to
put her project into execution

Often listening to the pilgrims tales she was so stimulated by their
simple speech mechanical to them but to her so full of deep meaning
that several times she was on the point of abandoning everything and
running away from home In imagination she already pictured herself by
Theodosias side dressed in coarse rags walking with a staff a wallet
on her back along the dusty road directing her wanderings from one
saints shrine to another free from envy earthly love or desire and
reaching at last the place where there is no more sorrow or sighing but
eternal joy and bliss

I shall come to a place and pray there and before having time to get
used to it or getting to love it I shall go farther I will go on till
my legs fail and Ill lie down and die somewhere and shall at last
reach that eternal quiet haven where there is neither sorrow nor
sighing thought Princess Mary

But afterwards when she saw her father and especially little Koko
Nicholas her resolve weakened She wept quietly and felt that she
was a sinner who loved her father and little nephew more than God





BOOK SEVEN 1810 11





CHAPTER I

The Bible legend tells us that the absence of laboridlenesswas a
condition of the first mans blessedness before the Fall Fallen man has
retained a love of idleness but the curse weighs on the race not only
because we have to seek our bread in the sweat of our brows but because
our moral nature is such that we cannot be both idle and at ease An
inner voice tells us we are in the wrong if we are idle If man could
find a state in which he felt that though idle he was fulfilling his
duty he would have found one of the conditions of mans primitive
blessedness And such a state of obligatory and irreproachable idleness
is the lot of a whole classthe military The chief attraction of
military service has consisted and will consist in this compulsory and
irreproachable idleness

Nicholas Rostv experienced this blissful condition to the full when
after 1807 he continued to serve in the Pvlograd regiment in which he
already commanded the squadron he had taken over from Denisov

Rostv had become a bluff goodnatured fellow whom his Moscow
acquaintances would have considered rather bad form but who was liked
and respected by his comrades subordinates and superiors and was well
contented with his life Of late in 1809 he found in letters from home
more frequent complaints from his mother that their affairs were falling
into greater and greater disorder and that it was time for him to come
back to gladden and comfort his old parents

Reading these letters Nicholas felt a dread of their wanting to take
him away from surroundings in which protected from all the
entanglements of life he was living so calmly and quietly He felt that
sooner or later he would have to reenter that whirlpool of life with
its embarrassments and affairs to be straightened out its accounts with
stewards quarrels and intrigues its ties society and with Snyas
love and his promise to her It was all dreadfully difficult and
complicated and he replied to his mother in cold formal letters in
French beginning My dear Mamma and ending Your obedient son
which said nothing of when he would return In 1810 he received letters
from his parents in which they told him of Natshas engagement to
Bolknski and that the wedding would be in a years time because the
old prince made difficulties This letter grieved and mortified
Nicholas In the first place he was sorry that Natsha for whom he
cared more than for anyone else in the family should be lost to the
home and secondly from his hussar point of view he regretted not to
have been there to show that fellow Bolknski that connection with him
was no such great honor after all and that if he loved Natsha he might
dispense with permission from his dotard father For a moment he
hesitated whether he should not apply for leave in order to see Natsha
before she was married but then came the maneuvers and considerations
about Snya and about the confusion of their affairs and Nicholas again
put it off But in the spring of that year he received a letter from
his mother written without his fathers knowledge and that letter
persuaded him to return She wrote that if he did not come and take
matters in hand their whole property would be sold by auction and they
would all have to go begging The count was so weak and trusted Mitenka
so much and was so goodnatured that everybody took advantage of him
and things were going from bad to worse For Gods sake I implore you
come at once if you do not wish to make me and the whole family
wretched wrote the countess

This letter touched Nicholas He had that common sense of a matterof
fact man which showed him what he ought to do

The right thing now was if not to retire from the service at any rate
to go home on leave Why he had to go he did not know but after his
afterdinner nap he gave orders to saddle Mars an extremely vicious
gray stallion that had not been ridden for a long time and when he
returned with the horse all in a lather he informed Lavrushka
Denisovs servant who had remained with him and his comrades who
turned up in the evening that he was applying for leave and was going
home Difficult and strange as it was for him to reflect that he would
go away without having heard from the staffand this interested him
extremelywhether he was promoted to a captaincy or would receive the
Order of St Anne for the last maneuvers strange as it was to think
that he would go away without having sold his three roans to the Polish
Count Golukhovski who was bargaining for the horses Rostv had betted
he would sell for two thousand rubles incomprehensible as it seemed
that the ball the hussars were giving in honor of the Polish
Mademoiselle Przazdziecka out of rivalry to the uhlans who had given
one in honor of their Polish Mademoiselle Borzozowska would take place
without himhe knew he must go away from this good bright world to
somewhere where everything was stupid and confused A week later he
obtained his leave His hussar comradesnot only those of his own
regiment but the whole brigadegave Rostv a dinner to which the
subscription was fifteen rubles a head and at which there were two
bands and two choirs of singers Rostv danced the Trepak with Major
Basov the tipsy officers tossed embraced and dropped Rostv the
soldiers of the third squadron tossed him too and shouted hurrah and
then they put him in his sleigh and escorted him as far as the first
post station

During the first half of the journeyfrom Kremenchug to Kievall
Rostvs thoughts as is usual in such cases were behind him with the
squadron but when he had gone more than halfway he began to forget his
three roans and Dozhoyveyko his quartermaster and to wonder anxiously
how things would be at Otradnoe and what he would find there Thoughts
of home grew stronger the nearer he approached itfar stronger as
though this feeling of his was subject to the law by which the force of
attraction is in inverse proportion to the square of the distance At
the last post station before Otradnoe he gave the driver a threeruble
tip and on arriving he ran breathlessly like a boy up the steps of
his home

After the rapture of meeting and after that odd feeling of unsatisfied
expectationthe feeling that everything is just the same so why did I
hurryNicholas began to settle down in his old home world His father
and mother were much the same only a little older What was new in them
was a certain uneasiness and occasional discord which there used not to
be and which as Nicholas soon found out was due to the bad state of
their affairs Snya was nearly twenty she had stopped growing prettier
and promised nothing more than she was already but that was enough She
exhaled happiness and love from the time Nicholas returned and the
faithful unalterable love of this girl had a gladdening effect on him
Ptya and Natsha surprised Nicholas most Ptya was a big handsome boy
of thirteen merry witty and mischievous with a voice that was
already breaking As for Natsha for a long while Nicholas wondered and
laughed whenever he looked at her

Youre not the same at all he said

How Am I uglier

On the contrary but what dignity A princess he whispered to her

Yes yes yes cried Natsha joyfully

She told him about her romance with Prince Andrew and of his visit to
Otradnoe and showed him his last letter

Well are you glad Natsha asked I am so tranquil and happy now

Very glad answered Nicholas He is an excellent fellow And are
you very much in love

How shall I put it replied Natsha I was in love with Bors with
my teacher and with Denisov but this is quite different I feel at
peace and settled I know that no better man than he exists and I am
calm and contented now Not at all as before

Nicholas expressed his disapproval of the postponement of the marriage
for a year but Natsha attacked her brother with exasperation proving
to him that it could not be otherwise and that it would be a bad thing
to enter a family against the fathers will and that she herself wished
it so

You dont at all understand she said

Nicholas was silent and agreed with her

Her brother often wondered as he looked at her She did not seem at all
like a girl in love and parted from her affianced husband She was even
tempered and calm and quite as cheerful as of old This amazed Nicholas
and even made him regard Bolknskis courtship skeptically He could not
believe that her fate was sealed especially as he had not seen her with
Prince Andrew It always seemed to him that there was something not
quite right about this intended marriage

Why this delay Why no betrothal he thought Once when he had
touched on this topic with his mother he discovered to his surprise
and somewhat to his satisfaction that in the depth of her soul she too
had doubts about this marriage

You see he writes said she showing her son a letter of Prince
Andrews with that latent grudge a mother always has in regard to a
daughters future married happiness he writes that he wont come
before December What can be keeping him Illness probably His health
is very delicate Dont tell Natsha And dont attach importance to her
being so bright thats because shes living through the last days of
her girlhood but I know what she is like every time we receive a letter
from him However God grant that everything turns out well She
always ended with these words He is an excellent man





CHAPTER II

After reaching home Nicholas was at first serious and even dull He was
worried by the impending necessity of interfering in the stupid business
matters for which his mother had called him home To throw off this
burden as quickly as possible on the third day after his arrival he
went angry and scowling and without answering questions as to where he
was going to Mitenkas lodge and demanded an account of everything But
what an account of everything might be Nicholas knew even less than the
frightened and bewildered Mitenka The conversation and the examination
of the accounts with Mitenka did not last long The village elder a
peasant delegate and the village clerk who were waiting in the
passage heard with fear and delight first the young counts voice
roaring and snapping and rising louder and louder and then words of
abuse dreadful words ejaculated one after the other

Robber Ungrateful wretch Ill hack the dog to pieces Im not
my father Robbing us and so on

Then with no less fear and delight they saw how the young count red in
the face and with bloodshot eyes dragged Mitenka out by the scruff of
the neck and applied his foot and knee to his behind with great agility
at convenient moments between the words shouting Be off Never let me
see your face here again you villain

Mitenka flew headlong down the six steps and ran away into the
shrubbery This shrubbery was a wellknown haven of refuge for culprits
at Otradnoe Mitenka himself returning tipsy from the town used to
hide there and many of the residents at Otradnoe hiding from Mitenka
knew of its protective qualities

Mitenkas wife and sistersinlaw thrust their heads and frightened
faces out of the door of a room where a bright samovar was boiling and
where the stewards high bedstead stood with its patchwork quilt

The young count paid no heed to them but breathing hard passed by
with resolute strides and went into the house

The countess who heard at once from the maids what had happened at the
lodge was calmed by the thought that now their affairs would certainly
improve but on the other hand felt anxious as to the effect this
excitement might have on her son She went several times to his door on
tiptoe and listened as he lighted one pipe after another

Next day the old count called his son aside and with an embarrassed
smile said to him

But you know my dear boy its a pity you got excited Mitenka has
told me all about it

I knew thought Nicholas that I should never understand anything in
this crazy world

You were angry that he had not entered those 700 rubles But they were
carried forwardand you did not look at the other page

Papa he is a blackguard and a thief I know he is And what I have
done I have done but if you like I wont speak to him again

No my dear boy the count too felt embarrassed He knew he had
mismanaged his wifes property and was to blame toward his children but
he did not know how to remedy it No I beg you to attend to the
business I am old I

No Papa Forgive me if I have caused you unpleasantness I understand
it all less than you do

Devil take all these peasants and money matters and carryings forward
from page to page he thought I used to understand what a corner
and the stakes at cards meant but carrying forward to another page I
dont understand at all said he to himself and after that he did not
meddle in business affairs But once the countess called her son and
informed him that she had a promissory note from Anna Mikhylovna for
two thousand rubles and asked him what he thought of doing with it

This answered Nicholas You say it rests with me Well I dont like
Anna Mikhylovna and I dont like Bors but they were our friends and
poor Well then this and he tore up the note and by so doing caused
the old countess to weep tears of joy After that young Rostv took no
further part in any business affairs but devoted himself with
passionate enthusiasm to what was to him a new pursuitthe chasefor
which his father kept a large establishment





CHAPTER III

The weather was already growing wintry and morning frosts congealed an
earth saturated by autumn rains The verdure had thickened and its
bright green stood out sharply against the brownish strips of winter rye
trodden down by the cattle and against the paleyellow stubble of the
spring sowing and the reddish strips ofbuckwheat The wooded ravines and the copses which at the end of
August had still been green islands amid black fields and stubble had
become golden and brightred islands amid the green winter rye The
hares had already half changed their summer coats the fox cubs were
beginning to scatter and the young wolves were bigger than dogs It was
the best time of the year for the chase The hounds of that ardent young
sportsman Rostv had not merely reached hard winter condition but were
so jaded that at a meeting of the huntsmen it was decided to give them a
three days rest and then on the sixteenth of September to go on a
distant expedition starting from the oak grove where there was an
undisturbed litter of wolf cubs

All that day the hounds remained at home It was frosty and the air was
sharp but toward evening the sky became overcast and it began to thaw
On the fifteenth when young Rostv in his dressing gown looked out of
the window he saw it was an unsurpassable morning for hunting it was
as if the sky were melting and sinking to the earth without any wind
The only motion in the air was that of the dripping microscopic
particles of drizzling mist The bare twigs in the garden were hung with
transparent drops which fell on the freshly fallen leaves The earth in
the kitchen garden looked wet and black and glistened like poppy seed
and at a short distance merged into the dull moist veil of mist
Nicholas went out into the wet and muddy porch There was a smell of
decaying leaves and of dog Milka a blackspotted broadhaunched bitch
with prominent black eyes got up on seeing her master stretched her
hind legs lay down like a hare and then suddenly jumped up and licked
him right on his nose and mustache Another borzoi a dog catching
sight of his master from the garden path arched his back and rushing
headlong toward the porch with lifted tail began rubbing himself
against his legs

Ohoy came at that moment that inimitable huntsmans call which
unites the deepest bass with the shrillest tenor and round the corner
came Daniel the head huntsman and head kennelman a gray wrinkled old
man with hair cut straight over his forehead Ukrainian fashion a long
bent whip in his hand and that look of independence and scorn of
everything that is only seen in huntsmen He doffed his Circassian cap
to his master and looked at him scornfully This scorn was not offensive
to his master Nicholas knew that this Daniel disdainful of everybody
and who considered himself above them was all the same his serf and
huntsman

Daniel Nicholas said timidly conscious at the sight of the weather
the hounds and the huntsman that he was being carried away by that
irresistible passion for sport which makes a man forget all his previous
resolutions as a lover forgets in the presence of his mistress

What orders your excellency said the huntsman in his deep bass deep
as a protodeacons and hoarse with hallooingand two flashing black
eyes gazed from under his brows at his master who was silent Can you
resist it those eyes seemed to be asking

Its a good day eh For a hunt and a gallop eh asked Nicholas
scratching Milka behind the ears

Daniel did not answer but winked instead

I sent Uvarka at dawn to listen his bass boomed out after a minutes
pause He says shes moved them into the Otradnoe enclosure They were
howling there This meant that the shewolf about whom they both
knew had moved with her cubs to the Otradnoe copse a small place a
mile and a half from the house

We ought to go dont you think so said Nicholas Come to me with
Uvarka

As you please

Then put off feeding them

Yes sir

Five minutes later Daniel and Uvarka were standing in Nicholas big
study Though Daniel was not a big man to see him in a room was like
seeing a horse or a bear on the floor among the furniture and
surroundings of human life Daniel himself felt this and as usual stood
just inside the door trying to speak softly and not move for fear of
breaking something in the masters apartment and he hastened to say all
that was necessary so as to get from under that ceiling out into the
open under the sky once more

Having finished his inquiries and extorted from Daniel an opinion that
the hounds were fit Daniel himself wished to go hunting Nicholas
ordered the horses to be saddled But just as Daniel was about to go
Natsha came in with rapid steps not having done up her hair or
finished dressing and with her old nurses big shawl wrapped round her
Ptya ran in at the same time

You are going asked Natsha I knew you would Snya said you
wouldnt go but I knew that today is the sort of day when you couldnt
help going

Yes we are going replied Nicholas reluctantly for today as he
intended to hunt seriously he did not want to take Natsha and Ptya
We are going but only wolf hunting it would be dull for you

You know it is my greatest pleasure said Natsha Its not fair you
are going by yourself are having the horses saddled and said nothing to
us about it

No barrier bars a Russians pathwell go shouted Ptya

But you cant Mamma said you mustnt said Nicholas to Natsha

Yes Ill go I shall certainly go said Natsha decisively Daniel
tell them to saddle for us and Michael must come with my dogs she
added to the huntsman

It seemed to Daniel irksome and improper to be in a room at all but to
have anything to do with a young lady seemed to him impossible He cast
down his eyes and hurried out as if it were none of his business
careful as he went not to inflict any accidental injury on the young
lady





CHAPTER IV

The old count who had always kept up an enormous hunting establishment
but had now handed it all completely over to his sons care being in
very good spirits on this fifteenth of September prepared to go out
with the others

In an hours time the whole hunting party was at the porch Nicholas
with a stern and serious air which showed that now was no time for
attending to trifles went past Natsha and Ptya who were trying to
tell him something He had a look at all the details of the hunt sent a
pack of hounds and huntsmen on ahead to find the quarry mounted his
chestnut Donets and whistling to his own leash of borzois set off
across the threshing ground to a field leading to the Otradnoe wood The
old counts horse a sorrel gelding called Viflyanka was led by the
groom in attendance on him while the count himself was to drive in a
small trap straight to a spot reserved for him

They were taking fiftyfour hounds with six hunt attendants and
whippersin Besides the family there were eight borzoi kennelmen and
more than forty borzois so that with the borzois on the leash
belonging to members of the family there were about a hundred and
thirty dogs and twenty horsemen

Each dog knew its master and its call Each man in the hunt knew his
business his place what he had to do As soon as they had passed the
fence they all spread out evenly and quietly without noise or talk
along the road and field leading to the Otradnoe covert

The horses stepped over the field as over a thick carpet now and then
splashing into puddles as they crossed a road The misty sky still
seemed to descend evenly and imperceptibly toward the earth the air was
still warm and silent Occasionally the whistle of a huntsman the
snort of a horse the crack of a whip or the whine of a straggling
hound could be heard

When they had gone a little less than a mile five more riders with dogs
appeared out of the mist approaching the Rostvs In front rode a
freshlooking handsome old man with a large gray mustache

Good morning Uncle said Nicholas when the old man drew near

Thats it Come on I was sure of it began Uncle He was a
distant relative of the Rostvs a man of small means and their
neighbor I knew you wouldnt be able to resist it and its a good
thing youre going Thats it Come on This was Uncles favorite
expression Take the covert at once for my Girchik says the Ilagins
are at Korniki with their hounds Thats it Come on Theyll take
the cubs from under your very nose

Thats where Im going Shall we join up our packs asked Nicholas

The hounds were joined into one pack and Uncle and Nicholas rode on
side by side Natsha muffled up in shawls which did not hide her eager
face and shining eyes galloped up to them She was followed by Ptya
who always kept close to her by Michael a huntsman and by a groom
appointed to look after her Ptya who was laughing whipped and pulled
at his horse Natsha sat easily and confidently on her black Arabchik
and reined him in without effort with a firm hand

Uncle looked round disapprovingly at Ptya and Natsha He did not
like to combine frivolity with the serious business of hunting

Good morning Uncle We are going too shouted Ptya

Good morning good morning But dont go overriding the hounds said
Uncle sternly

Nicholas what a fine dog Trunila is He knew me said Natsha
referring to her favorite hound

In the first place Trunila is not a dog but a harrier thought
Nicholas and looked sternly at his sister trying to make her feel the
distance that ought to separate them at that moment Natsha understood
it

You mustnt think well be in anyones way Uncle she said Well go
to our places and wont budge

A good thing too little countess said Uncle only mind you dont
fall off your horse he added becausethats it come onyouve
nothing to hold on to

The oasis of the Otradnoe covert came in sight a few hundred yards off
the huntsmen were already nearing it Rostv having finally settled
with Uncle where they should set on the hounds and having shown
Natsha where she was to standa spot where nothing could possibly run
outwent round above the ravine

Well nephew youre going for a big wolf said Uncle Mind and
dont let her slip

Thats as may happen answered Rostv Karay here he shouted
answering Uncles remark by this call to his borzoi Karay was a
shaggy old dog with a hanging jowl famous for having tackled a big wolf
unaided They all took up their places

The old count knowing his sons ardor in the hunt hurried so as not to
be late and the huntsmen had not yet reached their places when Count
Ily Rostv cheerful flushed and with quivering cheeks drove up with
his black horses over the winter rye to the place reserved for him
where a wolf might come out Having straightened his coat and fastened
on his hunting knives and horn he mounted his good sleek wellfed
and comfortable horse Viflyanka which was turning gray like himself
His horses and trap were sent home Count Ily Rostv though not at
heart a keen sportsman knew the rules of the hunt well and rode to the
bushy edge of the road where he was to stand arranged his reins
settled himself in the saddle and feeling that he was ready looked
about with a smile

Beside him was Simon Chekmar his personal attendant an old horseman
now somewhat stiff in the saddle Chekmar held in leash three formidable
wolfhounds who had however grown fat like their master and his horse
Two wise old dogs lay down unleashed Some hundred paces farther along
the edge of the wood stood Mitka the counts other groom a daring
horseman and keen rider to hounds Before the hunt by old custom the
count had drunk a silver cupful of mulled brandy taken a snack and
washed it down with half a bottle of his favorite Bordeaux

He was somewhat flushed with the wine and the drive His eyes were
rather moist and glittered more than usual and as he sat in his saddle
wrapped up in his fur coat he looked like a child taken out for an
outing

The thin hollowcheeked Chekmar having got everything ready kept
glancing at his master with whom he had lived on the best of terms for
thirty years and understanding the mood he was in expected a pleasant
chat A third person rode up circumspectly through the wood it was
plain that he had had a lesson and stopped behind the count This
person was a graybearded old man in a womans cloak with a tall peaked
cap on his head He was the buffoon who went by a womans name
Nastasya Ivnovna

Well Nastasya Ivnovna whispered the count winking at him If you
scare away the beast Danielll give it you

I know a thing or two myself said Nastasya Ivnovna

Hush whispered the count and turned to Simon Have you seen the
young countess he asked Where is she

With young Count Peter by the Zharov rank grass answered Simon
smiling Though shes a lady shes very fond of hunting

And youre surprised at the way she rides Simon eh said the count
Shes as good as many a man

Of course Its marvelous So bold so easy

And Nicholas Where is he By the Lyadov upland isnt he

Yes sir He knows where to stand He understands the matter so well
that Daniel and I are often quite astounded said Simon well knowing
what would please his master

Rides well eh And how well he looks on his horse eh

A perfect picture How he chased a fox out of the rank grass by the
Zavarzinsk thicket the other day Leaped a fearful place what a sight
when they rushed from the covert the horse worth a thousand rubles
and the rider beyond all price Yes one would have to search far to
find another as smart

To search far repeated the count evidently sorry Simon had not
said more To search far he said turning back the skirt of his coat
to get at his snuffbox

The other day when he came out from Mass in full uniform Michael
Sidorych Simon did not finish for on the still air he had
distinctly caught the music of the hunt with only two or three hounds
giving tongue He bent down his head and listened shaking a warning
finger at his master They are on the scent of the cubs he
whispered straight to the Lyadov uplands

The count forgetting to smooth out the smile on his face looked into
the distance straight before him down the narrow open space holding
the snuffbox in his hand but not taking any After the cry of the hounds
came the deep tones of the wolf call from Daniels hunting horn the
pack joined the first three hounds and they could be heard in full cry
with that peculiar lift in the note that indicates that they are after a
wolf The whippersin no longer set on the hounds but changed to the
cry of ulyulyu and above the others rose Daniels voice now a deep
bass now piercingly shrill His voice seemed to fill the whole wood and
carried far beyond out into the open field

After listening a few moments in silence the count and his attendant
convinced themselves that the hounds had separated into two packs the
sound of the larger pack eagerly giving tongue began to die away in
the distance the other pack rushed by the wood past the count and it
was with this that Daniels voice was heard calling ulyulyu The sounds
of both packs mingled and broke apart again but both were becoming more
distant

Simon sighed and stooped to straighten the leash a young borzoi had
entangled the count too sighed and noticing the snuffbox in his hand
opened it and took a pinch Back cried Simon to a borzoi that was
pushing forward out of the wood The count started and dropped the
snuffbox Nastasya Ivnovna dismounted to pick it up The count and
Simon were looking at him

Then unexpectedly as often happens the sound of the hunt suddenly
approached as if the hounds in full cry and Daniel ulyulyuing were just
in front of them

The count turned and saw on his right Mitka staring at him with eyes
starting out of his head raising his cap and pointing before him to the
other side

Look out he shouted in a voice plainly showing that he had long
fretted to utter that word and letting the borzois slip he galloped
toward the count

The count and Simon galloped out of the wood and saw on their left a
wolf which softly swaying from side to side was coming at a quiet lope
farther to the left to the very place where they were standing The
angry borzois whined and getting free of the leash rushed past the
horses feet at the wolf

The wolf paused turned its heavy forehead toward the dogs awkwardly
like a man suffering from the quinsy and still slightly swaying from
side to side gave a couple of leaps and with a swish of its tail
disappeared into the skirt of the wood At the same instant with a cry
like a wail first one hound then another and then another sprang
helterskelter from the wood opposite and the whole pack rushed across
the field toward the very spot where the wolf had disappeared The hazel
bushes parted behind the hounds and Daniels chestnut horse appeared
dark with sweat On its long back sat Daniel hunched forward capless
his disheveled gray hair hanging over his flushed perspiring face

Ulyulyulyu ulyulyu he cried When he caught sight of the count
his eyes flashed lightning

Blast you he shouted holding up his whip threateningly at the count

Youve let the wolf go What sportsmen and as if scorning to say
more to the frightened and shamefaced count he lashed the heaving
flanks of his sweating chestnut gelding with all the anger the count had
aroused and flew off after the hounds The count like a punished
schoolboy looked round trying by a smile to win Simons sympathy for
his plight But Simon was no longer there He was galloping round by the
bushes while the field was coming up on both sides all trying to head
the wolf but it vanished into the wood before they could do so





CHAPTER V

Nicholas Rostv meanwhile remained at his post waiting for the wolf By
the way the hunt approached and receded by the cries of the dogs whose
notes were familiar to him by the way the voices of the huntsmen
approached receded and rose he realized what was happening at the
copse He knew that young and old wolves were there that the hounds had
separated into two packs that somewhere a wolf was being chased and
that something had gone wrong He expected the wolf to come his way any
moment He made thousands of different conjectures as to where and from
what side the beast would come and how he would set upon it Hope
alternated with despair Several times he addressed a prayer to God that
the wolf should come his way He prayed with that passionate and
shamefaced feeling with which men pray at moments of great excitement
arising from trivial causes What would it be to Thee to do this for
me he said to God I know Thou art great and that it is a sin to ask
this of Thee but for Gods sake do let the old wolf come my way and let
Karay spring at itin sight of Uncle who is watching from over
thereand seize it by the throat in a death grip A thousand times
during that halfhour Rostv cast eager and restless glances over the
edge of the wood with the two scraggy oaks rising above the aspen
undergrowth and the gully with its waterworn side and Uncles cap
just visible above the bush on his right

No I shant have such luck thought Rostv yet what wouldnt it be
worth It is not to be Everywhere at cards and in war I am always
unlucky Memories of Austerlitz and of Dlokhov flashed rapidly and
clearly through his mind Only once in my life to get an old wolf I
want only that thought he straining eyes and ears and looking to the
left and then to the right and listening to the slightest variation of
note in the cries of the dogs

Again he looked to the right and saw something running toward him across
the deserted field No it cant be thought Rostv taking a deep
breath as a man does at the coming of something long hoped for The
height of happiness was reachedand so simply without warning or
noise or display that Rostv could not believe his eyes and remained
in doubt for over a second The wolf ran forward and jumped heavily over
a gully that lay in her path She was an old animal with a gray back and
big reddish belly She ran without hurry evidently feeling sure that no
one saw her Rostv holding his breath looked round at the borzois
They stood or lay not seeing the wolf or understanding the situation
Old Karay had turned his head and was angrily searching for fleas
baring his yellow teeth and snapping at his hind legs

Ulyulyulyu whispered Rostv pouting his lips The borzois jumped up
jerking the rings of the leashes and pricking their ears Karay finished
scratching his hindquarters and cocking his ears got up with quivering
tail from which tufts of matted hair hung down

Shall I loose them or not Nicholas asked himself as the wolf
approached him coming from the copse Suddenly the wolfs whole
physiognomy changed she shuddered seeing what she had probably never
seen beforehuman eyes fixed upon herand turning her head a little
toward Rostv she paused

Back or forward Eh no matter forward the wolf seemed to say to
herself and she moved forward without again looking round and with a
quiet long easy yet resolute lope

Ulyulyu cried Nicholas in a voice not his own and of its own accord
his good horse darted headlong downhill leaping over gullies to head
off the wolf and the borzois passed it running faster still Nicholas
did not hear his own cry nor feel that he was galloping nor see the
borzois nor the ground over which he went he saw only the wolf who
increasing her speed bounded on in the same direction along the hollow
The first to come into view was Milka with her black markings and
powerful quarters gaining upon the wolf Nearer and nearer now she
was ahead of it but the wolf turned its head to face her and instead
of putting on speed as she usually did Milka suddenly raised her tail
and stiffened her forelegs

Ulyulyulyulyu shouted Nicholas

The reddish Lyubim rushed forward from behind Milka sprang impetuously
at the wolf and seized it by its hindquarters but immediately jumped
aside in terror The wolf crouched gnashed her teeth and again rose
and bounded forward followed at the distance of a couple of feet by all
the borzois who did not get any closer to her

Shell get away No its impossible thought Nicholas still shouting
with a hoarse voice

Karay ulyulyu he shouted looking round for the old borzoi who
was now his only hope Karay with all the strength age had left him
stretched himself to the utmost and watching the wolf galloped heavily
aside to intercept it But the quickness of the wolfs lope and the
borzois slower pace made it plain that Karay had miscalculated
Nicholas could already see not far in front of him the wood where the
wolf would certainly escape should she reach it But coming toward him
he saw hounds and a huntsman galloping almost straight at the wolf
There was still hope A long yellowish young borzoi one Nicholas did
not know from another leash rushed impetuously at the wolf from in
front and almost knocked her over But the wolf jumped up more quickly
than anyone could have expected and gnashing her teeth flew at the
yellowish borzoi which with a piercing yelp fell with its head on the
ground bleeding from a gash in its side

Karay Old fellow wailed Nicholas

Thanks to the delay caused by this crossing of the wolfs path the old
dog with its felted hair hanging from its thigh was within five paces of
it As if aware of her danger the wolf turned her eyes on Karay tucked
her tail yet further between her legs and increased her speed But here
Nicholas only saw that something happened to Karaythe borzoi was
suddenly on the wolf and they rolled together down into a gully just in
front of them

That instant when Nicholas saw the wolf struggling in the gully with
the dogs while from under them could be seen her gray hair and
outstretched hind leg and her frightened choking head with her ears
laid back Karay was pinning her by the throat was the happiest moment
of his life With his hand on his saddlebow he was ready to dismount
and stab the wolf when she suddenly thrust her head up from among that
mass of dogs and then her forepaws were on the edge of the gully She
clicked her teeth Karay no longer had her by the throat leaped with a
movement of her hind legs out of the gully and having disengaged
herself from the dogs with tail tucked in again went forward Karay
his hair bristling and probably bruised or wounded climbed with
difficulty out of the gully

Oh my God Why Nicholas cried in despair

Uncles huntsman was galloping from the other side across the wolfs
path and his borzois once more stopped the animals advance She was
again hemmed in

Nicholas and his attendant with Uncle and his huntsman were all
riding round the wolf crying ulyulyu shouting and preparing to
dismount each moment that the wolf crouched back and starting forward
again every time she shook herself and moved toward the wood where she
would be safe

Already at the beginning of this chase Daniel hearing the ulyulyuing
had rushed out from the wood He saw Karay seize the wolf and checked
his horse supposing the affair to be over But when he saw that the
horsemen did not dismount and that the wolf shook herself and ran for
safety Daniel set his chestnut galloping not at the wolf but straight
toward the wood just as Karay had run to cut the animal off As a
result of this he galloped up to the wolf just when she had been
stopped a second time by Uncles borzois

Daniel galloped up silently holding a naked dagger in his left hand and
thrashing the laboring sides of his chestnut horse with his whip as if
it were a flail

Nicholas neither saw nor heard Daniel until the chestnut breathing
heavily panted past him and he heard the fall of a body and saw Daniel
lying on the wolfs back among the dogs trying to seize her by the
ears It was evident to the dogs the hunters and to the wolf herself
that all was now over The terrified wolf pressed back her ears and
tried to rise but the borzois stuck to her Daniel rose a little took
a step and with his whole weight as if lying down to rest fell on the
wolf seizing her by the ears Nicholas was about to stab her but
Daniel whispered Dont Well gag her and changing his position
set his foot on the wolfs neck A stick was thrust between her jaws and
she was fastened with a leash as if bridled her legs were bound
together and Daniel rolled her over once or twice from side to side

With happy exhausted faces they laid the old wolf alive on a shying
and snorting horse and accompanied by the dogs yelping at her took her
to the place where they were all to meet The hounds had killed two of
the cubs and the borzois three The huntsmen assembled with their booty
and their stories and all came to look at the wolf which with her
broadbrowed head hanging down and the bitten stick between her jaws
gazed with great glassy eyes at this crowd of dogs and men surrounding
her When she was touched she jerked her bound legs and looked wildly
yet simply at everybody Old Count Rostv also rode up and touched the
wolf

Oh what a formidable one said he A formidable one eh he asked
Daniel who was standing near

Yes your excellency answered Daniel quickly doffing his cap

The count remembered the wolf he had let slip and his encounter with
Daniel

Ah but you are a crusty fellow friend said the count

For sole reply Daniel gave him a shy childlike meek and amiable
smile





CHAPTER VI

The old count went home and Natsha and Ptya promised to return very
soon but as it was still early the hunt went farther At midday they
put the hounds into a ravine thickly overgrown with young trees
Nicholas standing in a fallow field could see all his whips

Facing him lay a field of winter rye there his own huntsman stood alone
in a hollow behind a hazel bush The hounds had scarcely been loosed
before Nicholas heard one he knew Voltorn giving tongue at intervals
other hounds joined in now pausing and now again giving tongue A
moment later he heard a cry from the wooded ravine that a fox had been
found and the whole pack joining together rushed along the ravine
toward the ryefield and away from Nicholas

He saw the whips in their red caps galloping along the edge of the
ravine he even saw the hounds and was expecting a fox to show itself
at any moment on the ryefield opposite

The huntsman standing in the hollow moved and loosed his borzois and
Nicholas saw a queer shortlegged red fox with a fine brush going hard
across the field The borzois bore down on it Now they drew close to
the fox which began to dodge between the field in sharper and sharper
curves trailing its brush when suddenly a strange white borzoi dashed
in followed by a black one and everything was in confusion the borzois
formed a starshaped figure scarcely swaying their bodies and with
tails turned away from the center of the group Two huntsmen galloped up
to the dogs one in a red cap the other a stranger in a green coat

Whats this thought Nicholas Wheres that huntsman from He is not
Uncles man

The huntsmen got the fox but stayed there a long time without strapping
it to the saddle Their horses bridled and with high saddles stood
near them and there too the dogs were lying The huntsmen waved their
arms and did something to the fox Then from that spot came the sound of
a horn with the signal agreed on in case of a fight

Thats Ilagins huntsman having a row with our Ivan said Nicholas
groom

Nicholas sent the man to call Natsha and Ptya to him and rode at a
footpace to the place where the whips were getting the hounds together
Several of the field galloped to the spot where the fight was going on

Nicholas dismounted and with Natsha and Ptya who had ridden up
stopped near the hounds waiting to see how the matter would end Out of
the bushes came the huntsman who had been fighting and rode toward his
young master with the fox tied to his crupper While still at a
distance he took off his cap and tried to speak respectfully but he was
pale and breathless and his face was angry One of his eyes was black
but he probably was not even aware of it

What has happened asked Nicholas

A likely thing killing a fox our dogs had hunted And it was my gray
bitch that caught it Go to law indeed He snatches at the fox I
gave him one with the fox Here it is on my saddle Do you want a taste
of this said the huntsman pointing to his dagger and probably
imagining himself still speaking to his foe

Nicholas not stopping to talk to the man asked his sister and Ptya to
wait for him and rode to the spot where the enemys Ilagins hunting
party was

The victorious huntsman rode off to join the field and there
surrounded by inquiring sympathizers recounted his exploits

The facts were that Ilagin with whom the Rostvs had a quarrel and were
at law hunted over places that belonged by custom to the Rostvs and
had now as if purposely sent his men to the very woods the Rostvs
were hunting and let his man snatch a fox their dogs had chased

Nicholas though he had never seen Ilagin with his usual absence of
moderation in judgment hated him cordially from reports of his
arbitrariness and violence and regarded him as his bitterest foe He
rode in angry agitation toward him firmly grasping his whip and fully
prepared to take the most resolute and desperate steps to punish his
enemy

Hardly had he passed an angle of the wood before a stout gentleman in a
beaver cap came riding toward him on a handsome ravenblack horse
accompanied by two hunt servants

Instead of an enemy Nicholas found in Ilagin a stately and courteous
gentleman who was particularly anxious to make the young counts
acquaintance Having ridden up to Nicholas Ilagin raised his beaver cap
and said he much regretted what had occurred and would have the man
punished who had allowed himself to seize a fox hunted by someone elses
borzois He hoped to become better acquainted with the count and invited
him to draw his covert

Natsha afraid that her brother would do something dreadful had
followed him in some excitement Seeing the enemies exchanging friendly
greetings she rode up to them Ilagin lifted his beaver cap still
higher to Natsha and said with a pleasant smile that the young
countess resembled Diana in her passion for the chase as well as in her
beauty of which he had heard much

To expiate his huntsmans offense Ilagin pressed the Rostvs to come to
an upland of his about a mile away which he usually kept for himself and
which he said swarmed with hares Nicholas agreed and the hunt now
doubled moved on

The way to Iligins upland was across the fields The hunt servants fell
into line The masters rode together Uncle Rostv and Ilagin kept
stealthily glancing at one anothers dogs trying not to be observed by
their companions and searching uneasily for rivals to their own borzois

Rostv was particularly struck by the beauty of a small purebred red
spotted bitch on Ilagins leash slender but with muscles like steel a
delicate muzzle and prominent black eyes He had heard of the swiftness
of Ilagins borzois and in that beautiful bitch saw a rival to his own
Milka

In the middle of a sober conversation begun by Ilagin about the years
harvest Nicholas pointed to the redspotted bitch

A fine little bitch that said he in a careless tone Is she swift

That one Yes shes a good dog gets what shes after answered
Ilagin indifferently of the redspotted bitch Erza for which a year
before he had given a neighbor three families of house serfs So in
your parts too the harvest is nothing to boast of Count he went on
continuing the conversation they had begun And considering it polite to
return the young counts compliment Ilagin looked at his borzois and
picked out Milka who attracted his attention by her breadth That
blackspotted one of yours is finewell shaped said he

Yes shes fast enough replied Nicholas and thought If only a
fullgrown hare would cross the field now Id show you what sort of
borzoi she is and turning to his groom he said he would give a ruble
to anyone who found a hare

I dont understand continued Ilagin how some sportsmen can be so
jealous about game and dogs For myself I can tell you Count I enjoy
riding in company such as this what could be better he again
raised his cap to Natsha but as for counting skins and what one
takes I dont care about that

Of course not

Or being upset because someone elses borzoi and not mine catches
something All I care about is to enjoy seeing the chase is it not so
Count For I consider that

Atu came the longdrawn cry of one of the borzoi whippersin who
had halted He stood on a knoll in the stubble holding his whip aloft
and again repeated his longdrawn cry Atu This call and the
uplifted whip meant that he saw a sitting hare

Ah he has found one I think said Ilagin carelessly Yes we must
ride up Shall we both course it answered Nicholas seeing in Erza
and Uncles red Rugay two rivals he had never yet had a chance of
pitting against his own borzois And suppose they outdo my Milka at
once he thought as he rode with Uncle and Ilagin toward the hare

A fullgrown one asked Ilagin as he approached the whip who had
sighted the hareand not without agitation he looked round and whistled
to Erza

And you Michael Nikanorovich he said addressing Uncle

The latter was riding with a sullen expression on his face

How can I join in Why youve given a village for each of your
borzois Thats it come on Yours are worth thousands Try yours
against one another you two and Ill look on

Rugay hey hey he shouted Rugayushka he added involuntarily by
this diminutive expressing his affection and the hopes he placed on this
red borzoi Natsha saw and felt the agitation the two elderly men and
her brother were trying to conceal and was herself excited by it

The huntsman stood halfway up the knoll holding up his whip and the
gentlefolk rode up to him at a footpace the hounds that were far off on
the horizon turned away from the hare and the whips but not the
gentlefolk also moved away All were moving slowly and sedately

How is it pointing asked Nicholas riding a hundred paces toward the
whip who had sighted the hare

But before the whip could reply the hare scenting the frost coming
next morning was unable to rest and leaped up The pack on leash rushed
downhill in full cry after the hare and from all sides the borzois that
were not on leash darted after the hounds and the hare All the hunt
who had been moving slowly shouted Stop calling in the hounds
while the borzoi whips with a cry of Atu galloped across the field
setting the borzois on the hare The tranquil Ilagin Nicholas Natsha
and Uncle flew reckless of where and how they went seeing only the
borzois and the hare and fearing only to lose sight even for an instant
of the chase The hare they had started was a strong and swift one When
he jumped up he did not run at once but pricked his ears listening to
the shouting and trampling that resounded from all sides at once He
took a dozen bounds not very quickly letting the borzois gain on him
and finally having chosen his direction and realized his danger laid
back his ears and rushed off headlong He had been lying in the stubble
but in front of him was the autumn sowing where the ground was soft The
two borzois of the huntsman who had sighted him having been the
nearest were the first to see and pursue him but they had not gone far
before Ilagins redspotted Erza passed them got within a length flew
at the hare with terrible swiftness aiming at his scut and thinking
she had seized him rolled over like a ball The hare arched his back
and bounded off yet more swiftly From behind Erza rushed the broad
haunched blackspotted Milka and began rapidly gaining on the hare

Milashka dear rose Nicholas triumphant cry It looked as if Milka
would immediately pounce on the hare but she overtook him and flew
past The hare had squatted Again the beautiful Erza reached him but
when close to the hares scut paused as if measuring the distance so as
not to make a mistake this time but seize his hind leg

Erza darling Ilagin wailed in a voice unlike his own Erza did not
hearken to his appeal At the very moment when she would have seized her
prey the hare moved and darted along the balk between the winter rye
and the stubble Again Erza and Milka were abreast running like a pair
of carriage horses and began to overtake the hare but it was easier
for the hare to run on the balk and the borzois did not overtake him so
quickly

Rugay Rugayushka Thats it come on came a third voice just then
and Uncles red borzoi straining and curving its back caught up with
the two foremost borzois pushed ahead of them regardless of the
terrible strain put on speed close to the hare knocked it off the balk
onto the ryefield again put on speed still more viciously sinking to
his knees in the muddy field and all one could see was how muddying
his back he rolled over with the hare A ring of borzois surrounded
him A moment later everyone had drawn up round the crowd of dogs Only
the delighted Uncle dismounted and cut off a pad shaking the hare
for the blood to drip off and anxiously glancing round with restless
eyes while his arms and legs twitched He spoke without himself knowing
whom to or what about Thats it come on Thats a dog There it
has beaten them all the thousandruble as well as the oneruble
borzois Thats it come on said he panting and looking wrathfully
around as if he were abusing someone as if they were all his enemies
and had insulted him and only now had he at last succeeded in
justifying himself There are your thousandruble ones Thats it
come on

Rugay heres a pad for you he said throwing down the hares muddy
pad Youve deserved it thats it come on

Shed tired herself out shed run it down three times by herself
said Nicholas also not listening to anyone and regardless of whether he
were heard or not

But what is there in running across it like that said Ilagins groom

Once she had missed it and turned it away any mongrel could take it
Ilagin was saying at the same time breathless from his gallop and his
excitement At the same moment Natsha without drawing breath screamed
joyously ecstatically and so piercingly that it set everyones ear
tingling By that shriek she expressed what the others expressed by all
talking at once and it was so strange that she must herself have been
ashamed of so wild a cry and everyone else would have been amazed at it
at any other time Uncle himself twisted up the hare threw it neatly
and smartly across his horses back as if by that gesture he meant to
rebuke everybody and with an air of not wishing to speak to anyone
mounted his bay and rode off The others all followed dispirited and
shamefaced and only much later were they able to regain their former
affectation of indifference For a long time they continued to look at
red Rugay who his arched back spattered with mud and clanking the ring
of his leash walked along just behind Uncles horse with the serene
air of a conqueror

Well I am like any other dog as long as its not a question of
coursing But when it is then look out his appearance seemed to
Nicholas to be saying

When much later Uncle rode up to Nicholas and began talking to him
he felt flattered that after what had happened Uncle deigned to
speak to him





CHAPTER VII

Toward evening Ilagin took leave of Nicholas who found that they were
so far from home that he accepted Uncles offer that the hunting party
should spend the night in his little village of Mikhylovna

And if you put up at my house that will be better still Thats it
come on said Uncle You see its damp weather and you could rest
and the little countess could be driven home in a trap

Uncles offer was accepted A huntsman was sent to Otradnoe for a
trap while Nicholas rode with Natsha and Ptya to Uncles house

Some five male domestic serfs big and little rushed out to the front
porch to meet their master A score of women serfs old and young as
well as children popped out from the back entrance to have a look at
the hunters who were arriving The presence of Natshaa woman a lady
and on horsebackraised the curiosity of the serfs to such a degree that
many of them came up to her stared her in the face and unabashed by
her presence made remarks about her as though she were some prodigy on
show and not a human being able to hear or understand what was said
about her

Arinka Look she sits sideways There she sits and her skirt
dangles See shes got a little hunting horn

Goodness gracious See her knife

Isnt she a Tartar

How is it you didnt go head over heels asked the boldest of all
addressing Natsha directly

Uncle dismounted at the porch of his little wooden house which stood
in the midst of an overgrown garden and after a glance at his
retainers shouted authoritatively that the superfluous ones should take
themselves off and that all necessary preparations should be made to
receive the guests and the visitors

The serfs all dispersed Uncle lifted Natsha off her horse and taking
her hand led her up the rickety wooden steps of the porch The house
with its bare unplastered log walls was not overcleanit did not seem
that those living in it aimed at keeping it spotlessbut neither was it
noticeably neglected In the entry there was a smell of fresh apples
and wolf and fox skins hung about

Uncle led the visitors through the anteroom into a small hall with a
folding table and red chairs then into the drawing room with a round
birchwood table and a sofa and finally into his private room where
there was a tattered sofa a worn carpet and portraits of Suvrov of
the hosts father and mother and of himself in military uniform The
study smelt strongly of tobacco and dogs Uncle asked his visitors to
sit down and make themselves at home and then went out of the room
Rugay his back still muddy came into the room and lay down on the
sofa cleaning himself with his tongue and teeth Leading from the study
was a passage in which a partition with ragged curtains could be seen
From behind this came womens laughter and whispers Natsha Nicholas
and Ptya took off their wraps and sat down on the sofa Ptya leaning
on his elbow fell asleep at once Natsha and Nicholas were silent
Their faces glowed they were hungry and very cheerful They looked at
one another now that the hunt was over and they were in the house
Nicholas no longer considered it necessary to show his manly superiority
over his sister Natsha gave him a wink and neither refrained long
from bursting into a peal of ringing laughter even before they had a
pretext ready to account for it

After a while Uncle came in in a Cossack coat blue trousers and
small top boots And Natsha felt that this costume the very one she
had regarded with surprise and amusement at Otradnoe was just the right
thing and not at all worse than a swallowtail or frock coat Uncle
too was in high spirits and far from being offended by the brothers and
sisters laughter it could never enter his head that they might be
laughing at his way of life he himself joined in the merriment

Thats right young countess thats it come on I never saw anyone
like her said he offering Nicholas a pipe with a long stem and with
a practiced motion of three fingers taking down another that had been
cut short Shes ridden all day like a man and is as fresh as ever

Soon after Uncles reappearance the door was opened evidently from
the sound by a barefooted girl and a stout rosy goodlooking woman of
about forty with a double chin and full red lips entered carrying a
large loaded tray With hospitable dignity and cordiality in her glance
and in every motion she looked at the visitors and with a pleasant
smile bowed respectfully In spite of her exceptional stoutness which
caused her to protrude her chest and stomach and throw back her head
this woman who was Uncles housekeeper trod very lightly She went
to the table set down the tray and with her plump white hands deftly
took from it the bottles and various hors doeuvres and dishes and
arranged them on the table When she had finished she stepped aside and
stopped at the door with a smile on her face Here I am I am she Now
do you understand Uncle her expression said to Rostv How could one
help understanding Not only Nicholas but even Natsha understood the
meaning of his puckered brow and the happy complacent smile that
slightly puckered his lips when Anisya Fdorovna entered On the tray
was a bottle of herb wine different kinds of vodka pickled mushrooms
rye cakes made with buttermilk honey in the comb still mead and
sparkling mead apples nuts raw and roasted and nutandhoney
sweets Afterwards she brought a freshly roasted chicken ham preserves
made with honey and preserves made with sugar

All this was the fruit of Anisya Fdorovnas housekeeping gathered and
prepared by her The smell and taste of it all had a smack of Anisya
Fdorovna herself a savor of juiciness cleanliness whiteness and
pleasant smiles

Take this little LadyCountess she kept saying as she offered
Natsha first one thing and then another

Natsha ate of everything and thought she had never seen or eaten such
buttermilk cakes such aromatic jam such honeyandnut sweets or such
a chicken anywhere Anisya Fdorovna left the room

After supper over their cherry brandy Rostv and Uncle talked of
past and future hunts of Rugay and Ilagins dogs while Natsha sat
upright on the sofa and listened with sparkling eyes She tried several
times to wake Ptya that he might eat something but he only muttered
incoherent words without waking up Natsha felt so lighthearted and
happy in these novel surroundings that she only feared the trap would
come for her too soon After a casual pause such as often occurs when
receiving friends for the first time in ones own house Uncle
answering a thought that was in his visitors minds said

This you see is how I am finishing my days Death will come Thats
it come on Nothing will remain Then why harm anyone

Uncles face was very significant and even handsome as he said this
Involuntarily Rostv recalled all the good he had heard about him from
his father and the neighbors Throughout the whole province Uncle had
the reputation of being the most honorable and disinterested of cranks
They called him in to decide family disputes chose him as executor
confided secrets to him elected him to be a justice and to other posts
but he always persistently refused public appointments passing the
autumn and spring in the fields on his bay gelding sitting at home in
winter and lying in his overgrown garden in summer

Why dont you enter the service Uncle

I did once but gave it up I am not fit for it Thats it come on I
cant make head or tail of it Thats for youI havent brains enough
Now hunting is another matterthats it come on Open the door
there he shouted Why have you shut it

The door at the end of the passage led to the huntsmens room as they
called the room for the hunt servants

There was a rapid patter of bare feet and an unseen hand opened the
door into the huntsmens room from which came the clear sounds of a
balalayka on which someone who was evidently a master of the art was
playing Natsha had been listening to those strains for some time and
now went out into the passage to hear better

Thats Mitka my coachman I have got him a good balalayka Im fond
of it said Uncle

It was the custom for Mitka to play the balalayka in the huntsmens room
when Uncle returned from the chase Uncle was fond of such music

How good Really very good said Nicholas with some unintentional
superciliousness as if ashamed to confess that the sounds pleased him
very much

Very good said Natsha reproachfully noticing her brothers tone
Not very good its simply delicious

Just as Uncles pickled mushrooms honey and cherry brandy had seemed
to her the best in the world so also that song at that moment seemed
to her the acme of musical delight

More please more cried Natsha at the door as soon as the balalayka
ceased Mitka tuned up afresh and recommenced thrumming the balalayka
to the air of My Lady with trills and variations Uncle sat
listening slightly smiling with his head on one side The air was
repeated a hundred times The balalayka was retuned several times and
the same notes were thrummed again but the listeners did not grow weary
of it and wished to hear it again and again Anisya Fdorovna came in
and leaned her portly person against the doorpost

You like listening she said to Natsha with a smile extremely like
Uncles Thats a good player of ours she added

He doesnt play that part right said Uncle suddenly with an
energetic gesture Here he ought to burst outthats it come onought
to burst out

Do you play then asked Natsha

Uncle did not answer but smiled

Anisya go and see if the strings of my guitar are all right I havent
touched it for a long time Thats itcome on Ive given it up

Anisya Fdorovna with her light step willingly went to fulfill her
errand and brought back the guitar

Without looking at anyone Uncle blew the dust off it and tapping the
case with his bony fingers tuned the guitar and settled himself in his
armchair He took the guitar a little above the fingerboard arching his
left elbow with a somewhat theatrical gesture and with a wink at
Anisya Fdorovna struck a single chord pure and sonorous and then
quietly smoothly and confidently began playing in very slow time not
My Lady but the wellknown song Came a maiden down the street The
tune played with precision and in exact time began to thrill in the
hearts of Nicholas and Natsha arousing in them the same kind of sober
mirth as radiated from Anisya Fdorovnas whole being Anisya Fdorovna
flushed and drawing her kerchief over her face went laughing out of the
room Uncle continued to play correctly carefully with energetic
firmness looking with a changed and inspired expression at the spot
where Anisya Fdorovna had just stood Something seemed to be laughing a
little on one side of his face under his gray mustaches especially as
the song grew brisker and the time quicker and when here and there as
he ran his fingers over the strings something seemed to snap

Lovely lovely Go on Uncle go on shouted Natsha as soon as he had
finished She jumped up and hugged and kissed him Nicholas Nicholas
she said turning to her brother as if asking him What is it moves me
so

Nicholas too was greatly pleased by Uncles playing and Uncle
played the piece over again Anisya Fdorovnas smiling face reappeared
in the doorway and behind hers other faces

Fetching water clear and sweet Stop dear maiden I entreat

played Uncle once more running his fingers skillfully over the
strings and then he stopped short and jerked his shoulders

Go on Uncle dear Natsha wailed in an imploring tone as if her life
depended on it

Uncle rose and it was as if there were two men in him one of them
smiled seriously at the merry fellow while the merry fellow struck a
nave and precise attitude preparatory to a folk dance

Now then niece he exclaimed waving to Natsha the hand that had
just struck a chord

Natsha threw off the shawl from her shoulders ran forward to face
Uncle and setting her arms akimbo also made a motion with her
shoulders and struck an attitude

Where how and when had this young countess educated by an emigree
French governess imbibed from the Russian air she breathed that spirit
and obtained that manner which the pas de chale would one would have
supposed long ago have effaced But the spirit and the movements were
those inimitable and unteachable Russian ones that Uncle had expected
of her As soon as she had struck her pose and smiled triumphantly
proudly and with sly merriment the fear that had at first seized
Nicholas and the others that she might not do the right thing was at an
end and they were already admiring her

 The French shawl dance

She did the right thing with such precision such complete precision
that Anisya Fdorovna who had at once handed her the handkerchief she
needed for the dance had tears in her eyes though she laughed as she
watched this slim graceful countess reared in silks and velvets and so
different from herself who yet was able to understand all that was in
Anisya and in Anisyas father and mother and aunt and in every Russian
man and woman

Well little countess thats itcome on cried Uncle with a joyous
laugh having finished the dance Well done niece Now a fine young
fellow must be found as husband for you Thats itcome on

Hes chosen already said Nicholas smiling

Oh said Uncle in surprise looking inquiringly at Natsha who
nodded her head with a happy smile

And such a one she said But as soon as she had said it a new train
of thoughts and feelings arose in her What did Nicholas smile mean
when he said chosen already Is he glad of it or not It is as if he
thought my Bolknski would not approve of or understand our gaiety But
he would understand it all Where is he now she thought and her face
suddenly became serious But this lasted only a second Dont dare to
think about it she said to herself and sat down again smilingly
beside Uncle begging him to play something more

Uncle played another song and a valse then after a pause he cleared
his throat and sang his favorite hunting song

As twas growing dark last night Fell the snow so soft and light

Uncle sang as peasants sing with full and nave conviction that the
whole meaning of a song lies in the words and that the tune comes of
itself and that apart from the words there is no tune which exists
only to give measure to the words As a result of this the unconsidered
tune like the song of a bird was extraordinarily good Natsha was in
ecstasies over Uncles singing She resolved to give up learning the
harp and to play only the guitar She asked Uncle for his guitar and
at once found the chords of the song

After nine oclock two traps and three mounted men who had been sent to
look for them arrived to fetch Natsha and Ptya The count and
countess did not know where they were and were very anxious said one of
the men

Ptya was carried out like a log and laid in the larger of the two
traps Natsha and Nicholas got into the other Uncle wrapped Natsha
up warmly and took leave of her with quite a new tenderness He
accompanied them on foot as far as the bridge that could not be crossed
so that they had to go round by the ford and he sent huntsmen to ride
in front with lanterns

Goodbye dear niece his voice called out of the darknessnot the
voice Natsha had known previously but the one that had sung As twas
growing dark last night

In the village through which they passed there were red lights and a
cheerful smell of smoke

What a darling Uncle is said Natsha when they had come out onto the
highroad

Yes returned Nicholas Youre not cold

No Im quite quite all right I feel so comfortable answered
Natsha almost perplexed by her feelings They remained silent a long
while The night was dark and damp They could not see the horses but
only heard them splashing through the unseen mud

What was passing in that receptive childlike soul that so eagerly caught
and assimilated all the diverse impressions of life How did they all
find place in her But she was very happy As they were nearing home she
suddenly struck up the air of As twas growing dark last nightthe tune
of which she had all the way been trying to get and had at last caught

Got it said Nicholas

What were you thinking about just now Nicholas inquired Natsha

They were fond of asking one another that question

I said Nicholas trying to remember Well you see first I thought
that Rugay the red hound was like Uncle and that if he were a man he
would always keep Uncle near him if not for his riding then for his
manner What a good fellow Uncle is Dont you think so Well and
you

I Wait a bit wait Yes first I thought that we are driving along
and imagining that we are going home but that heaven knows where we are
really going in the darkness and that we shall arrive and suddenly find
that we are not in Otradnoe but in Fairyland And then I thought No
nothing else

I know I expect you thought of him said Nicholas smiling as Natsha
knew by the sound of his voice

No said Natsha though she had in reality been thinking about Prince
Andrew at the same time as of the rest and of how he would have liked
Uncle And then I was saying to myself all the way How well Anisya
carried herself how well And Nicholas heard her spontaneous happy
ringing laughter And do you know she suddenly said I know that I
shall never again be as happy and tranquil as I am now

Rubbish nonsense humbug exclaimed Nicholas and he thought How
charming this Natsha of mine is I have no other friend like her and
never shall have Why should she marry We might always drive about
together

What a darling this Nicholas of mine is thought Natsha

Ah there are still lights in the drawing room she said pointing to
the windows of the house that gleamed invitingly in the moist velvety
darkness of the night





CHAPTER VIII

Count Ily Rostv had resigned the position of Marshal of the Nobility
because it involved him in too much expense but still his affairs did
not improve Natsha and Nicholas often noticed their parents conferring
together anxiously and privately and heard suggestions of selling the
fine ancestral Rostv house and estate near Moscow It was not necessary
to entertain so freely as when the count had been Marshal and life at
Otradnoe was quieter than in former years but still the enormous house
and its lodges were full of people and more than twenty sat down to
table every day These were all their own people who had settled down in
the house almost as members of the family or persons who were it
seemed obliged to live in the counts house Such were Dimmler the
musician and his wife Vogel the dancing master and his family Belova
an old maiden lady an inmate of the house and many others such as
Ptyas tutors the girls former governess and other people who simply
found it preferable and more advantageous to live in the counts house
than at home They had not as many visitors as before but the old
habits of life without which the count and countess could not conceive
of existence remained unchanged There was still the hunting
establishment which Nicholas had even enlarged the same fifty horses
and fifteen grooms in the stables the same expensive presents and
dinner parties to the whole district on name days there were still the
counts games of whist and boston at whichspreading out his cards so
that everybody could see themhe let himself be plundered of hundreds of
rubles every day by his neighbors who looked upon an opportunity to
play a rubber with Count Rostv as a most profitable source of income

The count moved in his affairs as in a huge net trying not to believe
that he was entangled but becoming more and more so at every step and
feeling too feeble to break the meshes or to set to work carefully and
patiently to disentangle them The countess with her loving heart felt
that her children were being ruined that it was not the counts fault
for he could not help being what he wasthat though he tried to hide
it he himself suffered from the consciousness of his own and his
childrens ruin and she tried to find means of remedying the position
From her feminine point of view she could see only one solution namely
for Nicholas to marry a rich heiress She felt this to be their last
hope and that if Nicholas refused the match she had found for him she
would have to abandon the hope of ever getting matters right This match
was with Julie Kargina the daughter of excellent and virtuous parents
a girl the Rostvs had known from childhood and who had now become a
wealthy heiress through the death of the last of her brothers

The countess had written direct to Julies mother in Moscow suggesting a
marriage between their children and had received a favorable answer from
her Kargina had replied that for her part she was agreeable and
everything depend on her daughters inclination She invited Nicholas to
come to Moscow

Several times the countess with tears in her eyes told her son that
now both her daughters were settled her only wish was to see him
married She said she could lie down in her grave peacefully if that
were accomplished Then she told him that she knew of a splendid girl
and tried to discover what he thought about marriage

At other times she praised Julie to him and advised him to go to Moscow
during the holidays to amuse himself Nicholas guessed what his mothers
remarks were leading to and during one of these conversations induced
her to speak quite frankly She told him that her only hope of getting
their affairs disentangled now lay in his marrying Julie Kargina

But Mamma suppose I loved a girl who has no fortune would you expect
me to sacrifice my feelings and my honor for the sake of money he
asked his mother not realizing the cruelty of his question and only
wishing to show his noblemindedness

No you have not understood me said his mother not knowing how to
justify herself You have not understood me Nikolenka It is your
happiness I wish for she added feeling that she was telling an
untruth and was becoming entangled She began to cry

Mamma dont cry Only tell me that you wish it and you know I will
give my life anything to put you at ease said Nicholas I would
sacrifice anything for youeven my feelings

But the countess did not want the question put like that she did not
want a sacrifice from her son she herself wished to make a sacrifice
for him

No you have not understood me dont let us talk about it she
replied wiping away her tears

Maybe I do love a poor girl said Nicholas to himself Am I to
sacrifice my feelings and my honor for money I wonder how Mamma could
speak so to me Because Snya is poor I must not love her he thought
must not respond to her faithful devoted love Yet I should certainly
be happier with her than with some dolllike Julie I can always
sacrifice my feelings for my familys welfare he said to himself but
I cant coerce my feelings If I love Snya that feeling is for me
stronger and higher than all else

Nicholas did not go to Moscow and the countess did not renew the
conversation with him about marriage She saw with sorrow and sometimes
with exasperation symptoms of a growing attachment between her son and
the portionless Snya Though she blamed herself for it she could not
refrain from grumbling at and worrying Snya often pulling her up
without reason addressing her stiffly as my dear and using the
formal you instead of the intimate thou in speaking to her The
kindhearted countess was the more vexed with Snya because that poor
darkeyed niece of hers was so meek so kind so devotedly grateful to
her benefactors and so faithfully unchangingly and unselfishly in
love with Nicholas that there were no grounds for finding fault with
her

Nicholas was spending the last of his leave at home A fourth letter had
come from Prince Andrew from Rome in which he wrote that he would have
been on his way back to Russia long ago had not his wound unexpectedly
reopened in the warm climate which obliged him to defer his return till
the beginning of the new year Natsha was still as much in love with
her betrothed found the same comfort in that love and was still as
ready to throw herself into all the pleasures of life as before but at
the end of the fourth month of their separation she began to have fits
of depression which she could not master She felt sorry for herself
sorry that she was being wasted all this time and of no use to
anyonewhile she felt herself so capable of loving and being loved

Things were not cheerful in the Rostvs home





CHAPTER IX

Christmas came and except for the ceremonial Mass the solemn and
wearisome Christmas congratulations from neighbors and servants and the
new dresses everyone put on there were no special festivities though
the calm frost of twenty degrees Reaumur the dazzling sunshine by day
and the starlight of the winter nights seemed to call for some special
celebration of the season

On the third day of Christmas week after the midday dinner all the
inmates of the house dispersed to various rooms It was the dullest time
of the day Nicholas who had been visiting some neighbors that morning
was asleep on the sittingroom sofa The old count was resting in his
study Snya sat in the drawing room at the round table copying a
design for embroidery The countess was playing patience Nastasya
Ivnovna the buffoon sat with a sad face at the window with two old
ladies Natsha came into the room went up to Snya glanced at what
she was doing and then went up to her mother and stood without
speaking

Why are you wandering about like an outcast asked her mother What
do you want

Him I want him now this minute I want him said Natsha with
glittering eyes and no sign of a smile

The countess lifted her head and looked attentively at her daughter

Dont look at me Mamma Dont look I shall cry directly

Sit down with me a little said the countess

Mamma I want him Why should I be wasted like this Mamma

Her voice broke tears gushed from her eyes and she turned quickly to
hide them and left the room

She passed into the sitting room stood there thinking awhile and then
went into the maids room There an old maidservant was grumbling at a
young girl who stood panting having just run in through the cold from
the serfs quarters

Stop playingtheres a time for everything said the old woman

Let her alone Kondratevna said Natsha Go Mavrushka go

Having released Mavrushka Natsha crossed the dancing hall and went to
the vestibule There an old footman and two young ones were playing
cards They broke off and rose as she entered

What can I do with them thought Natsha

Oh Nikita please go where can I send him Yes go to the yard
and fetch a fowl please a cock and you Misha bring me some oats

Just a few oats said Misha cheerfully and readily

Go go quickly the old man urged him

And you Theodore get me a piece of chalk

On her way past the butlers pantry she told them to set a samovar
though it was not at all the time for tea

Foka the butler was the most illtempered person in the house Natsha
liked to test her power over him He distrusted the order and asked
whether the samovar was really wanted

Oh dear what a young lady said Foka pretending to frown at Natsha

No one in the house sent people about or gave them as much trouble as
Natsha did She could not see people unconcernedly but had to send
them on some errand She seemed to be trying whether any of them would
get angry or sulky with her but the serfs fulfilled no ones orders so
readily as they did hers What can I do where can I go thought she
as she went slowly along the passage

Nastasya Ivnovna what sort of children shall I have she asked the
buffoon who was coming toward her in a womans jacket

Why fleas crickets grasshoppers answered the buffoon

O Lord O Lord its always the same Oh where am I to go What am I
to do with myself And tapping with her heels she ran quickly upstairs
to see Vogel and his wife who lived on the upper story

Two governesses were sitting with the Vogels at a table on which were
plates of raisins walnuts and almonds The governesses were discussing
whether it was cheaper to live in Moscow or Odessa Natsha sat down
listened to their talk with a serious and thoughtful air and then got
up again

The island of Madagascar she said Madagascar she repeated
articulating each syllable distinctly and not replying to Madame
Schoss who asked her what she was saying she went out of the room

Her brother Ptya was upstairs too with the man in attendance on him he
was preparing fireworks to let off that night

Ptya Ptya she called to him Carry me downstairs

Ptya ran up and offered her his back She jumped on it putting her
arms round his neck and he pranced along with her

No dont the island of Madagascar she said and jumping off his
back she went downstairs

Having as it were reviewed her kingdom tested her power and made sure
that everyone was submissive but that all the same it was dull Natsha
betook herself to the ballroom picked up her guitar sat down in a dark
corner behind a bookcase and began to run her fingers over the strings
in the bass picking out a passage she recalled from an opera she had
heard in Petersburg with Prince Andrew What she drew from the guitar
would have had no meaning for other listeners but in her imagination a
whole series of reminiscences arose from those sounds She sat behind
the bookcase with her eyes fixed on a streak of light escaping from the
pantry door and listened to herself and pondered She was in a mood for
brooding on the past

Snya passed to the pantry with a glass in her hand Natsha glanced at
her and at the crack in the pantry door and it seemed to her that she
remembered the light falling through that crack once before and Snya
passing with a glass in her hand Yes it was exactly the same thought
Natsha

Snya what is this she cried twanging a thick string

Oh you are there said Snya with a start and came near and
listened I dont know A storm she ventured timidly afraid of being
wrong

There Thats just how she started and just how she came up smiling
timidly when all this happened before thought Natsha and in just
the same way I thought there was something lacking in her

No its the chorus from The WaterCarrier listen and Natsha sang
the air of the chorus so that Snya should catch it Where were you
going she asked

To change the water in this glass I am just finishing the design

You always find something to do but I cant said Natsha And
wheres Nicholas

Asleep I think

Snya go and wake him said Natsha Tell him I want him to come and
sing

She sat awhile wondering what the meaning of it all having happened
before could be and without solving this problem or at all regretting
not having done so she again passed in fancy to the time when she was
with him and he was looking at her with a lovers eyes

Oh if only he would come quicker I am so afraid it will never be
And worst of all I am growing oldthats the thing There wont then
be in me what there is now But perhaps hell come today will come
immediately Perhaps he has come and is sitting in the drawing room
Perhaps he came yesterday and I have forgotten it She rose put down
the guitar and went to the drawing room

All the domestic circle tutors governesses and guests were already
at the tea table The servants stood round the tablebut Prince Andrew
was not there and life was going on as before

Ah here she is said the old count when he saw Natsha enter Well
sit down by me But Natsha stayed by her mother and glanced round as
if looking for something

Mamma she muttered give him to me give him Mamma quickly
quickly and she again had difficulty in repressing her sobs

She sat down at the table and listened to the conversation between the
elders and Nicholas who had also come to the table My God my God
The same faces the same talk Papa holding his cup and blowing in the
same way thought Natsha feeling with horror a sense of repulsion
rising up in her for the whole household because they were always the
same

After tea Nicholas Snya and Natsha went to the sitting room to
their favorite corner where their most intimate talks always began





CHAPTER X

Does it ever happen to you said Natsha to her brother when they
settled down in the sitting room does it ever happen to you to feel as
if there were nothing more to comenothing that everything good is
past And to feel not exactly dull but sad

I should think so he replied I have felt like that when everything
was all right and everyone was cheerful The thought has come into my
mind that I was already tired of it all and that we must all die Once
in the regiment I had not gone to some merrymaking where there was
music and suddenly I felt so depressed

Oh yes I know I know I know Natsha interrupted him When I was
quite little that used to be so with me Do you remember when I was
punished once about some plums You were all dancing and I sat sobbing
in the schoolroom I shall never forget it I felt sad and sorry for
everyone for myself and for everyone And I was innocentthat was the
chief thing said Natsha Do you remember

I remember answered Nicholas I remember that I came to you
afterwards and wanted to comfort you but do you know I felt ashamed
to We were terribly absurd I had a funny doll then and wanted to give
it to you Do you remember

And do you remember Natsha asked with a pensive smile how once
long long ago when we were quite little Uncle called us into the
studythat was in the old houseand it was darkwe went in and suddenly
there stood

A Negro chimed in Nicholas with a smile of delight Of course I
remember Even now I dont know whether there really was a Negro or if
we only dreamed it or were told about him

He was gray you remember and had white teeth and stood and looked at
us

Snya do you remember asked Nicholas

Yes yes I do remember something too Snya answered timidly

You know I have asked Papa and Mamma about that Negro said Natsha
and they say there was no Negro at all But you see you remember

Of course I do I remember his teeth as if I had just seen them

How strange it is Its as if it were a dream I like that

And do you remember how we rolled hardboiled eggs in the ballroom and
suddenly two old women began spinning round on the carpet Was that real
or not Do you remember what fun it was

Yes and you remember how Papa in his blue overcoat fired a gun in the
porch

So they went through their memories smiling with pleasure not the sad
memories of old age but poetic youthful onesthose impressions of
ones most distant past in which dreams and realities blendand they
laughed with quiet enjoyment

Snya as always did not quite keep pace with them though they shared
the same reminiscences

Much that they remembered had slipped from her mind and what she
recalled did not arouse the same poetic feeling as they experienced She
simply enjoyed their pleasure and tried to fit in with it

She only really took part when they recalled Snyas first arrival She
told them how afraid she had been of Nicholas because he had on a corded
jacket and her nurse had told her that she too would be sewn up with
cords

And I remember their telling me that you had been born under a
cabbage said Natsha and I remember that I dared not disbelieve it
then but knew that it was not true and I felt so uncomfortable

While they were talking a maid thrust her head in at the other door of
the sitting room

They have brought the cock Miss she said in a whisper

It isnt wanted Ptya Tell them to take it away replied Natsha

In the middle of their talk in the sitting room Dimmler came in and
went up to the harp that stood there in a corner He took off its cloth
covering and the harp gave out a jarring sound

Mr Dimmler please play my favorite nocturne by Field came the old
countess voice from the drawing room

Dimmler struck a chord and turning to Natsha Nicholas and Snya
remarked How quiet you young people are

Yes were philosophizing said Natsha glancing round for a moment
and then continuing the conversation They were now discussing dreams

Dimmler began to play Natsha went on tiptoe noiselessly to the table
took up a candle carried it out and returned seating herself quietly
in her former place It was dark in the room especially where they were
sitting on the sofa but through the big windows the silvery light of
the full moon fell on the floor Dimmler had finished the piece but
still sat softly running his fingers over the strings evidently
uncertain whether to stop or to play something else

Do you know said Natsha in a whisper moving closer to Nicholas and
Snya that when one goes on and on recalling memories one at last
begins to remember what happened before one was in the world

That is metempsychosis said Snya who had always learned well and
remembered everything The Egyptians believed that our souls have lived
in animals and will go back into animals again

No I dont believe we ever were in animals said Natsha still in a
whisper though the music had ceased But I am certain that we were
angels somewhere there and have been here and that is why we
remember

May I join you said Dimmler who had come up quietly and he sat down
by them

If we have been angels why have we fallen lower said Nicholas No
that cant be

Not lower who said we were lower How do I know what I was before
Natsha rejoined with conviction The soul is immortalwell then if I
shall always live I must have lived before lived for a whole eternity

Yes but it is hard for us to imagine eternity remarked Dimmler who
had joined the young folk with a mildly condescending smile but now
spoke as quietly and seriously as they

Why is it hard to imagine eternity said Natsha It is now today
and it will be tomorrow and always and there was yesterday and the
day before

Natsha Now its your turn Sing me something they heard the
countess say Why are you sitting there like conspirators

Mamma I dont at all want to replied Natsha but all the same she
rose

None of them not even the middleaged Dimmler wanted to break off
their conversation and quit that corner in the sitting room but Natsha
got up and Nicholas sat down at the clavichord Standing as usual in the
middle of the hall and choosing the place where the resonance was best
Natsha began to sing her mothers favorite song

She had said she did not want to sing but it was long since she had
sung and long before she again sang as she did that evening The
count from his study where he was talking to Mitenka heard her and
like a schoolboy in a hurry to run out to play blundered in his talk
while giving orders to the steward and at last stopped while Mitenka
stood in front of him also listening and smiling Nicholas did not take
his eyes off his sister and drew breath in time with her Snya as she
listened thought of the immense difference there was between herself
and her friend and how impossible it was for her to be anything like as
bewitching as her cousin The old countess sat with a blissful yet sad
smile and with tears in her eyes occasionally shaking her head She
thought of Natsha and of her own youth and of how there was something
unnatural and dreadful in this impending marriage of Natsha and Prince
Andrew

Dimmler who had seated himself beside the countess listened with
closed eyes

Ah Countess he said at last thats a European talent she has
nothing to learnwhat softness tenderness and strength

Ah how afraid I am for her how afraid I am said the countess not
realizing to whom she was speaking Her maternal instinct told her that
Natsha had too much of something and that because of this she would
not be happy Before Natsha had finished singing fourteenyearold
Ptya rushed in delightedly to say that some mummers had arrived

Natsha stopped abruptly

Idiot she screamed at her brother and running to a chair threw
herself on it sobbing so violently that she could not stop for a long
time

Its nothing Mamma really its nothing only Ptya startled me she
said trying to smile but her tears still flowed and sobs still choked
her

The mummers some of the house serfs dressed up as bears Turks
innkeepers and ladiesfrightening and funnybringing in with them the
cold from outside and a feeling of gaiety crowded at first timidly
into the anteroom then hiding behind one another they pushed into the
ballroom where shyly at first and then more and more merrily and
heartily they started singing dancing and playing Christmas games
The countess when she had identified them and laughed at their
costumes went into the drawing room The count sat in the ballroom
smiling radiantly and applauding the players The young people had
disappeared

Half an hour later there appeared among the other mummers in the
ballroom an old lady in a hooped skirtthis was Nicholas A Turkish girl
was Ptya A clown was Dimmler An hussar was Natsha and a Circassian
was Snya with burntcork mustache and eyebrows

After the condescending surprise nonrecognition and praise from those
who were not themselves dressed up the young people decided that their
costumes were so good that they ought to be shown elsewhere

Nicholas who as the roads were in splendid condition wanted to take
them all for a drive in his troyka proposed to take with them about a
dozen of the serf mummers and drive to Uncles

No why disturb the old fellow said the countess Besides you
wouldnt have room to turn round there If you must go go to the
Melyukovs

Melyukova was a widow who with her family and their tutors and
governesses lived three miles from the Rostvs

Thats right my dear chimed in the old count thoroughly aroused
Ill dress up at once and go with them Ill make Pashette open her
eyes

But the countess would not agree to his going he had had a bad leg all
these last days It was decided that the count must not go but that if
Louisa Ivnovna Madame Schoss would go with them the young ladies
might go to the Melyukovs Snya generally so timid and shy more
urgently than anyone begging Louisa Ivnovna not to refuse

Snyas costume was the best of all Her mustache and eyebrows were
extraordinarily becoming Everyone told her she looked very handsome
and she was in a spirited and energetic mood unusual with her Some
inner voice told her that now or never her fate would be decided and in
her male attire she seemed quite a different person Louisa Ivnovna
consented to go and in half an hour four troyka sleighs with large and
small bells their runners squeaking and whistling over the frozen snow
drove up to the porch

Natsha was foremost in setting a merry holiday tone which passing
from one to another grew stronger and reached its climax when they all
came out into the frost and got into the sleighs talking calling to
one another laughing and shouting

Two of the troykas were the usual household sleighs the third was the
old counts with a trotter from the Orlv stud as shaft horse the
fourth was Nicholas own with a short shaggy black shaft horse
Nicholas in his old ladys dress over which he had belted his hussar
overcoat stood in the middle of the sleigh reins in hand

It was so light that he could see the moonlight reflected from the metal
harness disks and from the eyes of the horses who looked round in alarm
at the noisy party under the shadow of the porch roof

Natsha Snya Madame Schoss and two maids got into Nicholas sleigh
Dimmler his wife and Ptya into the old counts and the rest of the
mummers seated themselves in the other two sleighs

You go ahead Zakhar shouted Nicholas to his fathers coachman
wishing for a chance to race past him

The old counts troyka with Dimmler and his party started forward
squeaking on its runners as though freezing to the snow its deeptoned
bell clanging The side horses pressing against the shafts of the
middle horse sank in the snow which was dry and glittered like sugar
and threw it up

Nicholas set off following the first sleigh behind him the others
moved noisily their runners squeaking At first they drove at a steady
trot along the narrow road While they drove past the garden the shadows
of the bare trees often fell across the road and hid the brilliant
moonlight but as soon as they were past the fence the snowy plain
bathed in moonlight and motionless spread out before them glittering
like diamonds and dappled with bluish shadows Bang bang went the
first sleigh over a cradle hole in the snow of the road and each of the
other sleighs jolted in the same way and rudely breaking the frost
bound stillness the troykas began to speed along the road one after
the other

A hares track a lot of tracks rang out Natshas voice through the
frostbound air

How light it is Nicholas came Snyas voice

Nicholas glanced round at Snya and bent down to see her face closer
Quite a new sweet face with black eyebrows and mustaches peeped up at
him from her sable fursso close and yet so distantin the moonlight

That used to be Snya thought he and looked at her closer and
smiled

What is it Nicholas

Nothing said he and turned again to the horses

When they came out onto the beaten highroadpolished by sleigh runners
and cut up by roughshod hoofs the marks of which were visible in the
moonlightthe horses began to tug at the reins of their own accord and
increased their pace The near side horse arching his head and breaking
into a short canter tugged at his traces The shaft horse swayed from
side to side moving his ears as if asking Isnt it time to begin
now In front already far ahead the deep bell of the sleigh ringing
farther and farther off the black horses driven by Zakhar could be
clearly seen against the white snow From that sleigh one could hear the
shouts laughter and voices of the mummers

Gee up my darlings shouted Nicholas pulling the reins to one side
and flourishing the whip

It was only by the keener wind that met them and the jerks given by the
side horses who pulled harderever increasing their gallopthat one
noticed how fast the troyka was flying Nicholas looked back With
screams squeals and waving of whips that caused even the shaft horses
to gallopthe other sleighs followed The shaft horse swung steadily
beneath the bow over its head with no thought of slackening pace and
ready to put on speed when required

Nicholas overtook the first sleigh They were driving downhill and
coming out upon a broad trodden track across a meadow near a river

Where are we thought he Its the Kosoy meadow I suppose But
nothis is something new Ive never seen before This isnt the Kosoy
meadow nor the Demkin hill and heaven only knows what it is It is
something new and enchanted Well whatever it may be And shouting
to his horses he began to pass the first sleigh

Zakhar held back his horses and turned his face which was already
covered with hoarfrost to his eyebrows

Nicholas gave the horses the rein and Zakhar stretching out his arms
clucked his tongue and let his horses go

Now look out master he cried

Faster still the two troykas flew side by side and faster moved the
feet of the galloping side horses Nicholas began to draw ahead Zakhar
while still keeping his arms extended raised one hand with the reins

No you wont master he shouted

Nicholas put all his horses to a gallop and passed Zakhar The horses
showered the fine dry snow on the faces of those in the sleighbeside
them sounded quick ringing bells and they caught confused glimpses of
swiftly moving legs and the shadows of the troyka they were passing The
whistling sound of the runners on the snow and the voices of girls
shrieking were heard from different sides

Again checking his horses Nicholas looked around him They were still
surrounded by the magic plain bathed in moonlight and spangled with
stars

Zakhar is shouting that I should turn to the left but why to the
left thought Nicholas Are we getting to the Melyukovs Is this
Melyukovka Heaven only knows where we are going and heaven knows what
is happening to usbut it is very strange and pleasant whatever it is
And he looked round in the sleigh

Look his mustache and eyelashes are all white said one of the
strange pretty unfamiliar peoplethe one with fine eyebrows and
mustache

I think this used to be Natsha thought Nicholas and that was
Madame Schoss but perhaps its not and this Circassian with the
mustache I dont know but I love her

Arent you cold he asked

They did not answer but began to laugh Dimmler from the sleigh behind
shouted somethingprobably something funnybut they could not make out
what he said

Yes yes some voices answered laughing

But here was a fairy forest with black moving shadows and a glitter of
diamonds and a flight of marble steps and the silver roofs of fairy
buildings and the shrill yells of some animals And if this is really
Melyukovka it is still stranger that we drove heaven knows where and
have come to Melyukovka thought Nicholas

It really was Melyukovka and maids and footmen with merry faces came
running out to the porch carrying candles

Who is it asked someone in the porch

The mummers from the counts I know by the horses replied some
voices





CHAPTER XI

Pelageya Danilovna Melyukova a broadly built energetic woman wearing
spectacles sat in the drawing room in a loose dress surrounded by her
daughters whom she was trying to keep from feeling dull They were
quietly dropping melted wax into snow and looking at the shadows the wax
figures would throw on the wall when they heard the steps and voices of
new arrivals in the vestibule

Hussars ladies witches clowns and bears after clearing their
throats and wiping the hoarfrost from their faces in the vestibule came
into the ballroom where candles were hurriedly lighted The
clownDimmlerand the ladyNicholasstarted a dance Surrounded by the
screaming children the mummers covering their faces and disguising
their voices bowed to their hostess and arranged themselves about the
room

Dear me theres no recognizing them And Natsha See whom she looks
like She really reminds me of somebody But Herr Dimmlerisnt he good
I didnt know him And how he dances Dear me theres a Circassian
Really how becoming it is to dear Snya And who is that Well you
have cheered us up Nikita and Vanyaclear away the tables And we were
sitting so quietly Ha ha ha The hussar the hussar Just like a
boy And the legs I cant look at him different voices were
saying

Natsha the young Melyukovs favorite disappeared with them into the
back rooms where a cork and various dressing gowns and male garments
were called for and received from the footman by bare girlish arms from
behind the door Ten minutes later all the young Melyukovs joined the
mummers

Pelageya Danilovna having given orders to clear the rooms for the
visitors and arranged about refreshments for the gentry and the serfs
went about among the mummers without removing her spectacles peering
into their faces with a suppressed smile and failing to recognize any of
them It was not merely Dimmler and the Rostvs she failed to recognize
she did not even recognize her own daughters or her late husbands
dressing gowns and uniforms which they had put on

And who is this she asked her governess peering into the face of her
own daughter dressed up as a KazanTartar I suppose it is one of the
Rostvs Well Mr Hussar and what regiment do you serve in she asked
Natsha Here hand some fruit jelly to the Turk she ordered the
butler who was handing things round Thats not forbidden by his law

Sometimes as she looked at the strange but amusing capers cut by the
dancers whohaving decided once for all that being disguised no one
would recognize themwere not at all shy Pelageya Danilovna hid her
face in her handkerchief and her whole stout body shook with
irrepressible kindly elderly laughter

My little Sasha Look at Sasha she said

After Russian country dances and chorus dances Pelageya Danilovna made
the serfs and gentry join in one large circle a ring a string and a
silver ruble were fetched and they all played games together

In an hour all the costumes were crumpled and disordered The corked
eyebrows and mustaches were smeared over the perspiring flushed and
merry faces Pelageya Danilovna began to recognize the mummers admired
their cleverly contrived costumes and particularly how they suited the
young ladies and she thanked them all for having entertained her so
well The visitors were invited to supper in the drawing room and the
serfs had something served to them in the ballroom

Now to tell ones fortune in the empty bathhouse is frightening said
an old maid who lived with the Melyukovs during supper

Why said the eldest Melyukov girl

You wouldnt go it takes courage

Ill go said Snya

Tell what happened to the young lady said the second Melyukov girl

Well began the old maid a young lady once went out took a cock
laid the table for two all properly and sat down After sitting a
while she suddenly hears someone coming a sleigh drives up with
harness bells she hears him coming He comes in just in the shape of a
man like an officercomes in and sits down to table with her

Ah ah screamed Natsha rolling her eyes with horror

Yes And how did he speak

Yes like a man Everything quite all right and he began persuading
her and she should have kept him talking till cockcrow but she got
frightened just got frightened and hid her face in her hands Then he
caught her up It was lucky the maids ran in just then

Now why frighten them said Pelageya Danilovna

Mamma you used to try your fate yourself said her daughter

And how does one do it in a barn inquired Snya

Well say you went to the barn now and listened It depends on what
you hear hammering and knockingthats bad but a sound of shifting
grain is good and one sometimes hears that too

Mamma tell us what happened to you in the barn

Pelageya Danilovna smiled

Oh Ive forgotten she replied But none of you would go

Yes I will Pelageya Danilovna let me Ill go said Snya

Well why not if youre not afraid

Louisa Ivnovna may I asked Snya

Whether they were playing the ring and string game or the ruble game or
talking as now Nicholas did not leave Snyas side and gazed at her
with quite new eyes It seemed to him that it was only today thanks to
that burntcork mustache that he had fully learned to know her And
really that evening Snya was brighter more animated and prettier
than Nicholas had ever seen her before

So thats what she is like what a fool I have been he thought gazing
at her sparkling eyes and under the mustache a happy rapturous smile
dimpled her cheeks a smile he had never seen before

Im not afraid of anything said Snya May I go at once She got
up

They told her where the barn was and how she should stand and listen
and they handed her a fur cloak She threw this over her head and
shoulders and glanced at Nicholas

What a darling that girl is thought he And what have I been
thinking of till now

Snya went out into the passage to go to the barn Nicholas went hastily
to the front porch saying he felt too hot The crowd of people really
had made the house stuffy

Outside there was the same cold stillness and the same moon but even
brighter than before The light was so strong and the snow sparkled with
so many stars that one did not wish to look up at the sky and the real
stars were unnoticed The sky was black and dreary while the earth was
gay

I am a fool a fool what have I been waiting for thought Nicholas
and running out from the porch he went round the corner of the house and
along the path that led to the back porch He knew Snya would pass that
way Halfway lay some snowcovered piles of firewood and across and
along them a network of shadows from the bare old lime trees fell on the
snow and on the path This path led to the barn The log walls of the
barn and its snowcovered roof that looked as if hewn out of some
precious stone sparkled in the moonlight A tree in the garden snapped
with the frost and then all was again perfectly silent His bosom
seemed to inhale not air but the strength of eternal youth and gladness

From the back porch came the sound of feet descending the steps the
bottom step upon which snow had fallen gave a ringing creak and he heard
the voice of an old maidservant saying Straight straight along the
path Miss Only dont look back

I am not afraid answered Snyas voice and along the path toward
Nicholas came the crunching whistling sound of Snyas feet in her thin
shoes

Snya came along wrapped in her cloak She was only a couple of paces
away when she saw him and to her too he was not the Nicholas she had
known and always slightly feared He was in a womans dress with
tousled hair and a happy smile new to Snya She ran rapidly toward him

Quite different and yet the same thought Nicholas looking at her
face all lit up by the moonlight He slipped his arms under the cloak
that covered her head embraced her pressed her to him and kissed her
on the lips that wore a mustache and had a smell of burnt cork Snya
kissed him full on the lips and disengaging her little hands pressed
them to his cheeks

Snya Nicholas was all they said They ran to the barn and
then back again reentering he by the front and she by the back porch





CHAPTER XII

When they all drove back from Pelageya Danilovnas Natsha who always
saw and noticed everything arranged that she and Madame Schoss should
go back in the sleigh with Dimmler and Snya with Nicholas and the
maids

On the way back Nicholas drove at a steady pace instead of racing and
kept peering by that fantastic alltransforming light into Snyas face
and searching beneath the eyebrows and mustache for his former and his
present Snya from whom he had resolved never to be parted again He
looked and recognizing in her both the old and the new Snya and being
reminded by the smell of burnt cork of the sensation of her kiss
inhaled the frosty air with a full breast and looking at the ground
flying beneath him and at the sparkling sky felt himself again in
fairyland

Snya is it well with thee he asked from time to time

Yes she replied And with thee

When halfway home Nicholas handed the reins to the coachman and ran for
a moment to Natshas sleigh and stood on its wing

Natsha he whispered in French do you know I have made up my mind
about Snya

Have you told her asked Natsha suddenly beaming all over with joy

Oh how strange you are with that mustache and those eyebrows
Natshaare you glad

I am so glad so glad I was beginning to be vexed with you I did not
tell you but you have been treating her badly What a heart she has
Nicholas I am horrid sometimes but I was ashamed to be happy while
Snya was not continued Natsha Now I am so glad Well run back to
her

No wait a bit Oh how funny you look cried Nicholas peering
into her face and finding in his sister too something new unusual and
bewitchingly tender that he had not seen in her before Natsha its
magical isnt it

Yes she replied You have done splendidly

Had I seen her before as she is now thought Nicholas I should long
ago have asked her what to do and have done whatever she told me and
all would have been well

So you are glad and I have done right

Oh quite right I had a quarrel with Mamma some time ago about it
Mamma said she was angling for you How could she say such a thing I
nearly stormed at Mamma I will never let anyone say anything bad of
Snya for there is nothing but good in her

Then its all right said Nicholas again scrutinizing the expression
of his sisters face to see if she was in earnest Then he jumped down
and his boots scrunching the snow ran back to his sleigh The same
happy smiling Circassian with mustache and beaming eyes looking up
from under a sable hood was still sitting there and that Circassian
was Snya and that Snya was certainly his future happy and loving
wife

When they reached home and had told their mother how they had spent the
evening at the Melyukovs the girls went to their bedroom When they
had undressed but without washing off the cork mustaches they sat a
long time talking of their happiness They talked of how they would live
when they were married how their husbands would be friends and how
happy they would be On Natshas table stood two looking glasses which
Dunyasha had prepared beforehand

Only when will all that be I am afraid never It would be too
good said Natsha rising and going to the looking glasses

Sit down Natsha perhaps youll see him said Snya

Natsha lit the candles one on each side of one of the looking glasses
and sat down

I see someone with a mustache said Natsha seeing her own face

You mustnt laugh Miss said Dunyasha

With Snyas help and the maids Natsha got the glass she held into
the right position opposite the other her face assumed a serious
expression and she sat silent She sat a long time looking at the
receding line of candles reflected in the glasses and expecting from
tales she had heard to see a coffin or him Prince Andrew in that
last dim indistinctly outlined square But ready as she was to take the
smallest speck for the image of a man or of a coffin she saw nothing
She began blinking rapidly and moved away from the looking glasses

Why is it others see things and I dont she said You sit down now
Snya You absolutely must tonight Do it for me Today I feel so
frightened

Snya sat down before the glasses got the right position and began
looking

Now Miss Snya is sure to see something whispered Dunyasha while
you do nothing but laugh

Snya heard this and Natshas whisper

I know she will She saw something last year

For about three minutes all were silent

Of course she will whispered Natsha but did not finish suddenly
Snya pushed away the glass she was holding and covered her eyes with
her hand

Oh Natsha she cried

Did you see Did you What was it exclaimed Natsha holding up the
looking glass

Snya had not seen anything she was just wanting to blink and to get up
when she heard Natsha say Of course she will She did not wish to
disappoint either Dunyasha or Natsha but it was hard to sit still She
did not herself know how or why the exclamation escaped her when she
covered her eyes

You saw him urged Natsha seizing her hand

Yes Wait a bit I saw him Snya could not help saying not yet
knowing whom Natsha meant by him Nicholas or Prince Andrew

But why shouldnt I say I saw something Others do see Besides who can
tell whether I saw anything or not flashed through Snyas mind

Yes I saw him she said

How Standing or lying

No I saw At first there was nothing then I saw him lying down

Andrew lying Is he ill asked Natsha her frightened eyes fixed on
her friend

No on the contrary on the contrary His face was cheerful and he
turned to me And when saying this she herself fancied she had really
seen what she described

Well and then Snya

After that I could not make out what there was something blue and
red

Snya When will he come back When shall I see him O God how afraid
I am for him and for myself and about everything Natsha began and
without replying to Snyas words of comfort she got into bed and long
after her candle was out lay openeyed and motionless gazing at the
moonlight through the frosty windowpanes





CHAPTER XIII

Soon after the Christmas holidays Nicholas told his mother of his love
for Snya and of his firm resolve to marry her The countess who had
long noticed what was going on between them and was expecting this
declaration listened to him in silence and then told her son that he
might marry whom he pleased but that neither she nor his father would
give their blessing to such a marriage Nicholas for the first time
felt that his mother was displeased with him and that despite her love
for him she would not give way Coldly without looking at her son she
sent for her husband and when he came tried briefly and coldly to
inform him of the facts in her sons presence but unable to restrain
herself she burst into tears of vexation and left the room The old
count began irresolutely to admonish Nicholas and beg him to abandon his
purpose Nicholas replied that he could not go back on his word and his
father sighing and evidently disconcerted very soon became silent and
went in to the countess In all his encounters with his son the count
was always conscious of his own guilt toward him for having wasted the
family fortune and so he could not be angry with him for refusing to
marry an heiress and choosing the dowerless Snya On this occasion he
was only more vividly conscious of the fact that if his affairs had not
been in disorder no better wife for Nicholas than Snya could have been
wished for and that no one but himself with his Mitenka and his
uncomfortable habits was to blame for the condition of the family
finances

The father and mother did not speak of the matter to their son again
but a few days later the countess sent for Snya and with a cruelty
neither of them expected reproached her niece for trying to catch
Nicholas and for ingratitude Snya listened silently with downcast eyes
to the countess cruel words without understanding what was required of
her She was ready to sacrifice everything for her benefactors Self
sacrifice was her most cherished idea but in this case she could not see
what she ought to sacrifice or for whom She could not help loving the
countess and the whole Rostv family but neither could she help loving
Nicholas and knowing that his happiness depended on that love She was
silent and sad and did not reply Nicholas felt the situation to be
intolerable and went to have an explanation with his mother He first
implored her to forgive him and Snya and consent to their marriage
then he threatened that if she molested Snya he would at once marry her
secretly

The countess with a coldness her son had never seen in her before
replied that he was of age that Prince Andrew was marrying without his
fathers consent and he could do the same but that she would never
receive that intriguer as her daughter

Exploding at the word intriguer Nicholas raising his voice told his
mother he had never expected her to try to force him to sell his
feelings but if that were so he would say for the last time But he
had no time to utter the decisive word which the expression of his face
caused his mother to await with terror and which would perhaps have
forever remained a cruel memory to them both He had not time to say it
for Natsha with a pale and set face entered the room from the door at
which she had been listening

Nicholas you are talking nonsense Be quiet be quiet be quiet I
tell you she almost screamed so as to drown his voice

Mamma darling its not at all so my poor sweet darling she said
to her mother who conscious that they had been on the brink of a
rupture gazed at her son with terror but in the obstinacy and
excitement of the conflict could not and would not give way

Nicholas Ill explain to you Go away Listen Mamma darling said
Natsha

Her words were incoherent but they attained the purpose at which she
was aiming

The countess sobbing heavily hid her face on her daughters breast
while Nicholas rose clutching his head and left the room

Natsha set to work to effect a reconciliation and so far succeeded
that Nicholas received a promise from his mother that Snya should not
be troubled while he on his side promised not to undertake anything
without his parents knowledge

Firmly resolved after putting his affairs in order in the regiment to
retire from the army and return and marry Snya Nicholas serious
sorrowful and at variance with his parents but as it seemed to him
passionately in love left at the beginning of January to rejoin his
regiment

After Nicholas had gone things in the Rostv household were more
depressing than ever and the countess fell ill from mental agitation

Snya was unhappy at the separation from Nicholas and still more so on
account of the hostile tone the countess could not help adopting toward
her The count was more perturbed than ever by the condition of his
affairs which called for some decisive action Their town house and
estate near Moscow had inevitably to be sold and for this they had to
go to Moscow But the countess health obliged them to delay their
departure from day to day

Natsha who had borne the first period of separation from her betrothed
lightly and even cheerfully now grew more agitated and impatient every
day The thought that her best days which she would have employed in
loving him were being vainly wasted with no advantage to anyone
tormented her incessantly His letters for the most part irritated her
It hurt her to think that while she lived only in the thought of him he
was living a real life seeing new places and new people that interested
him The more interesting his letters were the more vexed she felt Her
letters to him far from giving her any comfort seemed to her a
wearisome and artificial obligation She could not write because she
could not conceive the possibility of expressing sincerely in a letter
even a thousandth part of what she expressed by voice smile and
glance She wrote to him formal monotonous and dry letters to which
she attached no importance herself and in the rough copies of which the
countess corrected her mistakes in spelling

There was still no improvement in the countess health but it was
impossible to defer the journey to Moscow any longer Natshas
trousseau had to be ordered and the house sold Moreover Prince Andrew
was expected in Moscow where old Prince Bolknski was spending the
winter and Natsha felt sure he had already arrived

So the countess remained in the country and the count taking Snya and
Natsha with him went to Moscow at the end of January





BOOK EIGHT 1811 12





CHAPTER I

After Prince Andrews engagement to Natsha Pierre without any apparent
cause suddenly felt it impossible to go on living as before Firmly
convinced as he was of the truths revealed to him by his benefactor and
happy as he had been in perfecting his inner man to which he had
devoted himself with such ardorall the zest of such a life vanished
after the engagement of Andrew and Natsha and the death of Joseph
Alexeevich the news of which reached him almost at the same time Only
the skeleton of life remained his house a brilliant wife who now
enjoyed the favors of a very important personage acquaintance with all
Petersburg and his court service with its dull formalities And this
life suddenly seemed to Pierre unexpectedly loathsome He ceased keeping
a diary avoided the company of the Brothers began going to the club
again drank a great deal and came once more in touch with the bachelor
sets leading such a life that the Countess Hlne thought it necessary
to speak severely to him about it Pierre felt that she was right and
to avoid compromising her went away to Moscow

In Moscow as soon as he entered his huge house in which the faded and
fading princesses still lived with its enormous retinue as soon as
driving through the town he saw the Iberian shrine with innumerable
tapers burning before the golden covers of the icons the Kremlin Square
with its snow undisturbed by vehicles the sleigh drivers and hovels of
the Sivtsev Vrazhok those old Moscovites who desired nothing hurried
nowhere and were ending their days leisurely when he saw those old
Moscow ladies the Moscow balls and the English Club he felt himself
at home in a quiet haven In Moscow he felt at peace at home warm and
dirty as in an old dressing gown

Moscow society from the old women down to the children received Pierre
like a longexpected guest whose place was always ready awaiting him
For Moscow society Pierre was the nicest kindest most intellectual
merriest and most magnanimous of cranks a heedless genial nobleman of
the old Russian type His purse was always empty because it was open to
everyone

Benefit performances poor pictures statues benevolent societies
gypsy choirs schools subscription dinners sprees Freemasons
churches and booksno one and nothing met with a refusal from him and
had it not been for two friends who had borrowed large sums from him and
taken him under their protection he would have given everything away
There was never a dinner or soiree at the club without him As soon as
he sank into his place on the sofa after two bottles of Margaux he was
surrounded and talking disputing and joking began When there were
quarrels his kindly smile and welltimed jests reconciled the
antagonists The masonic dinners were dull and dreary when he was not
there

When after a bachelor supper he rose with his amiable and kindly smile
yielding to the entreaties of the festive company to drive off somewhere
with them shouts of delight and triumph arose among the young men At
balls he danced if a partner was needed Young ladies married and
unmarried liked him because without making love to any of them he was
equally amiable to all especially after supper Il est charmant il
na pas de sexe they said of him

 He is charming he has no sex

Pierre was one of those retired gentlemeninwaiting of whom there were
hundreds goodhumoredly ending their days in Moscow

How horrified he would have been seven years before when he first
arrived from abroad had he been told that there was no need for him to
seek or plan anything that his rut had long been shaped eternally
predetermined and that wriggle as he might he would be what all in his
position were He could not have believed it Had he not at one time
longed with all his heart to establish a republic in Russia then
himself to be a Napoleon then to be a philosopher and then a
strategist and the conqueror of Napoleon Had he not seen the
possibility of and passionately desired the regeneration of the sinful
human race and his own progress to the highest degree of perfection
Had he not established schools and hospitals and liberated his serfs

But instead of all thathere he was the wealthy husband of an
unfaithful wife a retired gentlemaninwaiting fond of eating and
drinking and as he unbuttoned his waistcoat of abusing the government
a bit a member of the Moscow English Club and a universal favorite in
Moscow society For a long time he could not reconcile himself to the
idea that he was one of those same retired Moscow gentlemeninwaiting
he had so despised seven years before

Sometimes he consoled himself with the thought that he was only living
this life temporarily but then he was shocked by the thought of how
many like himself had entered that life and that club temporarily
with all their teeth and hair and had only left it when not a single
tooth or hair remained

In moments of pride when he thought of his position it seemed to him
that he was quite different and distinct from those other retired
gentlemeninwaiting he had formerly despised they were empty stupid
contented fellows satisfied with their position while I am still
discontented and want to do something for mankind But perhaps all these
comrades of mine struggled just like me and sought something new a path
in life of their own and like me were brought by force of
circumstances society and raceby that elemental force against which
man is powerlessto the condition I am in said he to himself in
moments of humility and after living some time in Moscow he no longer
despised but began to grow fond of to respect and to pity his
comrades in destiny as he pitied himself

Pierre no longer suffered moments of despair hypochondria and disgust
with life but the malady that had formerly found expression in such
acute attacks was driven inwards and never left him for a moment What
for Why What is going on in the world he would ask himself in
perplexity several times a day involuntarily beginning to reflect anew
on the meaning of the phenomena of life but knowing by experience that
there were no answers to these questions he made haste to turn away from
them and took up a book or hurried off to the club or to Apollon
Nikolevichs to exchange the gossip of the town

Hlne who has never cared for anything but her own body and is one of
the stupidest women in the world thought Pierre is regarded by
people as the acme of intelligence and refinement and they pay homage
to her Napoleon Bonaparte was despised by all as long as he was great
but now that he has become a wretched comedian the Emperor Francis wants
to offer him his daughter in an illegal marriage The Spaniards through
the Catholic clergy offer praise to God for their victory over the
French on the fourteenth of June and the French also through the
Catholic clergy offer praise because on that same fourteenth of June
they defeated the Spaniards My brother Masons swear by the blood that
they are ready to sacrifice everything for their neighbor but they do
not give a ruble each to the collections for the poor and they
intrigue the Astraea Lodge against the Manna Seekers and fuss about an
authentic Scotch carpet and a charter that nobody needs and the meaning
of which the very man who wrote it does not understand We all profess
the Christian law of forgiveness of injuries and love of our neighbors
the law in honor of which we have built in Moscow forty times forty
churchesbut yesterday a deserter was knouted to death and a minister of
that same law of love and forgiveness a priest gave the soldier a
cross to kiss before his execution So thought Pierre and the whole of
this general deception which everyone accepts accustomed as he was to
it astonished him each time as if it were something new I understand
the deception and confusion he thought but how am I to tell them all
that I see I have tried and have always found that they too in the
depths of their souls understand it as I do and only try not to see it
So it appears that it must be so But Iwhat is to become of me
thought he He had the unfortunate capacity many men especially
Russians have of seeing and believing in the possibility of goodness
and truth but of seeing the evil and falsehood of life too clearly to
be able to take a serious part in it Every sphere of work was
connected in his eyes with evil and deception Whatever he tried to
be whatever he engaged in the evil and falsehood of it repulsed him
and blocked every path of activity Yet he had to live and to find
occupation It was too dreadful to be under the burden of these
insoluble problems so he abandoned himself to any distraction in order
to forget them He frequented every kind of society drank much bought
pictures engaged in building and above allread

He read and read everything that came to hand On coming home while
his valets were still taking off his things he picked up a book and
began to read From reading he passed to sleeping from sleeping to
gossip in drawing rooms of the club from gossip to carousals and women
from carousals back to gossip reading and wine Drinking became more
and more a physical and also a moral necessity Though the doctors
warned him that with his corpulence wine was dangerous for him he drank
a great deal He was only quite at ease when having poured several
glasses of wine mechanically into his large mouth he felt a pleasant
warmth in his body an amiability toward all his fellows and a
readiness to respond superficially to every idea without probing it
deeply Only after emptying a bottle or two did he feel dimly that the
terribly tangled skein of life which previously had terrified him was
not as dreadful as he had thought He was always conscious of some
aspect of that skein as with a buzzing in his head after dinner or
supper he chatted or listened to conversation or read But under the
influence of wine he said to himself It doesnt matter Ill get it
unraveled I have a solution ready but have no time nowIll think it
all out later on But the later on never came

In the morning on an empty stomach all the old questions appeared as
insoluble and terrible as ever and Pierre hastily picked up a book and
if anyone came to see him he was glad

Sometimes he remembered how he had heard that soldiers in war when
entrenched under the enemys fire if they have nothing to do try hard
to find some occupation the more easily to bear the danger To Pierre
all men seemed like those soldiers seeking refuge from life some in
ambition some in cards some in framing laws some in women some in
toys some in horses some in politics some in sport some in wine and
some in governmental affairs Nothing is trivial and nothing is
important its all the sameonly to save oneself from it as best one
can thought Pierre Only not to see it that dreadful it





CHAPTER II

At the beginning of winter Prince Nicholas Bolknski and his daughter
moved to Moscow At that time enthusiasm for the Emperor Alexanders
regime had weakened and a patriotic and antiFrench tendency prevailed
there and this together with his past and his intellect and his
originality at once made Prince Nicholas Bolknski an object of
particular respect to the Moscovites and the center of the Moscow
opposition to the government

The prince had aged very much that year He showed marked signs of
senility by a tendency to fall asleep forgetfulness of quite recent
events remembrance of remote ones and the childish vanity with which
he accepted the role of head of the Moscow opposition In spite of this
the old man inspired in all his visitors alike a feeling of respectful
venerationespecially of an evening when he came in to tea in his old
fashioned coat and powdered wig and aroused by anyone told his abrupt
stories of the past or uttered yet more abrupt and scathing criticisms
of the present For them all that oldfashioned house with its gigantic
mirrors preRevolution furniture powdered footmen and the stern
shrewd old man himself a relic of the past century with his gentle
daughter and the pretty Frenchwoman who were reverently devoted to him
presented a majestic and agreeable spectacle But the visitors did not
reflect that besides the couple of hours during which they saw their
host there were also twentytwo hours in the day during which the
private and intimate life of the house continued

Latterly that private life had become very trying for Princess Mary
There in Moscow she was deprived of her greatest pleasurestalks with
the pilgrims and the solitude which refreshed her at Bald Hillsand she
had none of the advantages and pleasures of city life She did not go
out into society everyone knew that her father would not let her go
anywhere without him and his failing health prevented his going out
himself so that she was not invited to dinners and evening parties She
had quite abandoned the hope of getting married She saw the coldness
and malevolence with which the old prince received and dismissed the
young men possible suitors who sometimes appeared at their house She
had no friends during this visit to Moscow she had been disappointed in
the two who had been nearest to her Mademoiselle Bourienne with whom
she had never been able to be quite frank had now become unpleasant to
her and for various reasons Princess Mary avoided her Julie with whom
she had corresponded for the last five years was in Moscow but proved
to be quite alien to her when they met Just then Julie who by the
death of her brothers had become one of the richest heiresses in Moscow
was in the full whirl of society pleasures She was surrounded by young
men who she fancied had suddenly learned to appreciate her worth
Julie was at that stage in the life of a society woman when she feels
that her last chance of marrying has come and that her fate must be
decided now or never On Thursdays Princess Mary remembered with a
mournful smile that she now had no one to write to since Juliewhose
presence gave her no pleasure was here and they met every week Like the
old emigre who declined to marry the lady with whom he had spent his
evenings for years she regretted Julies presence and having no one to
write to In Moscow Princess Mary had no one to talk to no one to whom
to confide her sorrow and much sorrow fell to her lot just then The
time for Prince Andrews return and marriage was approaching but his
request to her to prepare his father for it had not been carried out in
fact it seemed as if matters were quite hopeless for at every mention
of the young Countess Rostva the old prince who apart from that was
usually in a bad temper lost control of himself Another lately added
sorrow arose from the lessons she gave her six yearold nephew To her
consternation she detected in herself in relation to little Nicholas
some symptoms of her fathers irritability However often she told
herself that she must not get irritable when teaching her nephew almost
every time that pointer in hand she sat down to show him the French
alphabet she so longed to pour her own knowledge quickly and easily
into the childwho was already afraid that Auntie might at any moment
get angrythat at his slightest inattention she trembled became
flustered and heated raised her voice and sometimes pulled him by the
arm and put him in the corner Having put him in the corner she would
herself begin to cry over her cruel evil nature and little Nicholas
following her example would sob and without permission would leave his
corner come to her pull her wet hands from her face and comfort her
But what distressed the princess most of all was her fathers
irritability which was always directed against her and had of late
amounted to cruelty Had he forced her to prostrate herself to the
ground all night had he beaten her or made her fetch wood or water it
would never have entered her mind to think her position hard but this
loving despotthe more cruel because he loved her and for that reason
tormented himself and herknew how not merely to hurt and humiliate her
deliberately but to show her that she was always to blame for
everything Of late he had exhibited a new trait that tormented Princess
Mary more than anything else this was his everincreasing intimacy with
Mademoiselle Bourienne The idea that at the first moment of receiving
the news of his sons intentions had occurred to him in jestthat if
Andrew got married he himself would marry Bouriennehad evidently
pleased him and latterly he had persistently and as it seemed to
Princess Mary merely to offend her shown special endearments to the
companion and expressed his dissatisfaction with his daughter by
demonstrations of love of Bourienne

One day in Moscow in Princess Marys presence she thought her father
did it purposely when she was there the old prince kissed Mademoiselle
Bouriennes hand and drawing her to him embraced her affectionately
Princess Mary flushed and ran out of the room A few minutes later
Mademoiselle Bourienne came into Princess Marys room smiling and making
cheerful remarks in her agreeable voice Princess Mary hastily wiped
away her tears went resolutely up to Mademoiselle Bourienne and
evidently unconscious of what she was doing began shouting in angry
haste at the Frenchwoman her voice breaking Its horrible vile
inhuman to take advantage of the weakness She did not finish
Leave my room she exclaimed and burst into sobs

Next day the prince did not say a word to his daughter but she noticed
that at dinner he gave orders that Mademoiselle Bourienne should be
served first After dinner when the footman handed coffee and from
habit began with the princess the prince suddenly grew furious threw
his stick at Philip and instantly gave instructions to have him
conscripted for the army

He doesnt obey I said it twice and he doesnt obey She is the
first person in this house shes my best friend cried the prince
And if you allow yourself he screamed in a fury addressing Princess
Mary for the first time to forget yourself again before her as you
dared to do yesterday I will show you who is master in this house Go
Dont let me set eyes on you beg her pardon

Princess Mary asked Mademoiselle Bouriennes pardon and also her
fathers pardon for herself and for Philip the footman who had begged
for her intervention

At such moments something like a pride of sacrifice gathered in her
soul And suddenly that father whom she had judged would look for his
spectacles in her presence fumbling near them and not seeing them or
would forget something that had just occurred or take a false step with
his failing legs and turn to see if anyone had noticed his feebleness
or worst of all at dinner when there were no visitors to excite him
would suddenly fall asleep letting his napkin drop and his shaking head
sink over his plate He is old and feeble and I dare to condemn him
she thought at such moments with a feeling of revulsion against
herself





CHAPTER III

In 1811 there was living in Moscow a French doctorMetivierwho had
rapidly become the fashion He was enormously tall handsome amiable as
Frenchmen are and was as all Moscow said an extraordinarily clever
doctor He was received in the best houses not merely as a doctor but
as an equal

Prince Nicholas had always ridiculed medicine but latterly on
Mademoiselle Bouriennes advice had allowed this doctor to visit him and
had grown accustomed to him Metivier came to see the prince about twice
a week

On December 6St Nicholas Day and the princes name dayall Moscow
came to the princes front door but he gave orders to admit no one and
to invite to dinner only a small number a list of whom he gave to
Princess Mary

Metivier who came in the morning with his felicitations considered it
proper in his quality of doctor de forcer la consigne as he told
Princess Mary and went in to see the prince It happened that on that
morning of his name day the prince was in one of his worst moods He had
been going about the house all the morning finding fault with everyone
and pretending not to understand what was said to him and not to be
understood himself Princess Mary well knew this mood of quiet absorbed
querulousness which generally culminated in a burst of rage and she
went about all that morning as though facing a cocked and loaded gun and
awaited the inevitable explosion Until the doctors arrival the morning
had passed off safely After admitting the doctor Princess Mary sat
down with a book in the drawing room near the door through which she
could hear all that passed in the study

 To force the guard

At first she heard only Metiviers voice then her fathers then both
voices began speaking at the same time the door was flung open and on
the threshold appeared the handsome figure of the terrified Metivier
with his shock of black hair and the prince in his dressing gown and
fez his face distorted with fury and the pupils of his eyes rolled
downwards

You dont understand shouted the prince but I do French spy slave
of Buonaparte spy get out of my house Be off I tell you

Metivier shrugging his shoulders went up to Mademoiselle Bourienne who
at the sound of shouting had run in from an adjoining room

The prince is not very well bile and rush of blood to the head Keep
calm I will call again tomorrow said Metivier and putting his
fingers to his lips he hastened away

Through the study door came the sound of slippered feet and the cry
Spies traitors traitors everywhere Not a moments peace in my own
house

After Metiviers departure the old prince called his daughter in and
the whole weight of his wrath fell on her She was to blame that a spy
had been admitted Had he not told her yes told her to make a list
and not to admit anyone who was not on that list Then why was that
scoundrel admitted She was the cause of it all With her he said he
could not have a moments peace and could not die quietly

No maam We must part we must part Understand that understand it
I cannot endure any more he said and left the room Then as if
afraid she might find some means of consolation he returned and trying
to appear calm added And dont imagine I have said this in a moment of
anger I am calm I have thought it over and it will be carried outwe
must part so find some place for yourself But he could not
restrain himself and with the virulence of which only one who loves is
capable evidently suffering himself he shook his fists at her and
screamed

If only some fool would marry her Then he slammed the door sent for
Mademoiselle Bourienne and subsided into his study

At two oclock the six chosen guests assembled for dinner

These gueststhe famous Count Rostopchin Prince Lopukhin with his
nephew General Chatrov an old war comrade of the princes and of the
younger generation Pierre and Bors Drubetskyawaited the prince in the
drawing room

Bors who had come to Moscow on leave a few days before had been
anxious to be presented to Prince Nicholas Bolknski and had contrived
to ingratiate himself so well that the old prince in his case made an
exception to the rule of not receiving bachelors in his house

The princes house did not belong to what is known as fashionable
society but his little circlethough not much talked about in townwas
one it was more flattering to be received in than any other Bors had
realized this the week before when the commanderinchief in his
presence invited Rostopchin to dinner on St Nicholas Day and
Rostopchin had replied that he could not come

On that day I always go to pay my devotions to the relics of Prince
Nicholas Bolknski

Oh yes yes replied the commanderinchief How is he

The small group that assembled before dinner in the lofty oldfashioned
drawing room with its old furniture resembled the solemn gathering of a
court of justice All were silent or talked in low tones Prince
Nicholas came in serious and taciturn Princess Mary seemed even quieter
and more diffident than usual The guests were reluctant to address her
feeling that she was in no mood for their conversation Count Rostopchin
alone kept the conversation going now relating the latest town news
and now the latest political gossip

Lopukhin and the old general occasionally took part in the conversation
Prince Bolknski listened as a presiding judge receives a report only
now and then silently or by a brief word showing that he took heed of
what was being reported to him The tone of the conversation was such as
indicated that no one approved of what was being done in the political
world Incidents were related evidently confirming the opinion that
everything was going from bad to worse but whether telling a story or
giving an opinion the speaker always stopped or was stopped at the
point beyond which his criticism might touch the sovereign himself

At dinner the talk turned on the latest political news Napoleons
seizure of the Duke of Oldenburgs territory and the Russian Note
hostile to Napoleon which had been sent to all the European courts

Bonaparte treats Europe as a pirate does a captured vessel said Count
Rostopchin repeating a phrase he had uttered several times before One
only wonders at the longsuffering or blindness of the crowned heads
Now the Popes turn has come and Bonaparte doesnt scruple to depose the
head of the Catholic Churchyet all keep silent Our sovereign alone has
protested against the seizure of the Duke of Oldenburgs territory and
even Count Rostopchin paused feeling that he had reached the limit
beyond which censure was impossible

Other territories have been offered in exchange for the Duchy of
Oldenburg said Prince Bolknski He shifts the Dukes about as I might
move my serfs from Bald Hills to Bogucharovo or my Ryazan estates

The Duke of Oldenburg bears his misfortunes with admirable strength of
character and resignation remarked Bors joining in respectfully

He said this because on his journey from Petersburg he had had the honor
of being presented to the Duke Prince Bolknski glanced at the young
man as if about to say something in reply but changed his mind
evidently considering him too young

I have read our protests about the Oldenburg affair and was surprised
how badly the Note was worded remarked Count Rostopchin in the casual
tone of a man dealing with a subject quite familiar to him

Pierre looked at Rostopchin with nave astonishment not understanding
why he should be disturbed by the bad composition of the Note

Does it matter Count how the Note is worded he asked so long as
its substance is forcible

My dear fellow with our five hundred thousand troops it should be easy
to have a good style returned Count Rostopchin

Pierre now understood the counts dissatisfaction with the wording of
the Note

One would have thought quill drivers enough had sprung up remarked
the old prince There in Petersburg they are always writingnot notes
only but even new laws My Andrew there has written a whole volume of
laws for Russia Nowadays they are always writing and he laughed
unnaturally

There was a momentary pause in the conversation the old general cleared
his throat to draw attention

Did you hear of the last event at the review in Petersburg The figure
cut by the new French ambassador

Eh Yes I heard something he said something awkward in His Majestys
presence

His Majesty drew attention to the Grenadier division and to the march
past continued the general and it seems the ambassador took no
notice and allowed himself to reply that We in France pay no attention
to such trifles The Emperor did not condescend to reply At the next
review they say the Emperor did not once deign to address him

All were silent On this fact relating to the Emperor personally it was
impossible to pass any judgment

Impudent fellows said the prince You know Metivier I turned him
out of my house this morning He was here they admitted him in spite of
my request that they should let no one in he went on glancing angrily
at his daughter

And he narrated his whole conversation with the French doctor and the
reasons that convinced him that Metivier was a spy Though these reasons
were very insufficient and obscure no one made any rejoinder

After the roast champagne was served The guests rose to congratulate
the old prince Princess Mary too went round to him

He gave her a cold angry look and offered her his wrinkled clean
shaven cheek to kiss The whole expression of his face told her that he
had not forgotten the mornings talk that his decision remained in
force and only the presence of visitors hindered his speaking of it to
her now

When they went into the drawing room where coffee was served the old
men sat together

Prince Nicholas grew more animated and expressed his views on the
impending war

He said that our wars with Bonaparte would be disastrous so long as we
sought alliances with the Germans and thrust ourselves into European
affairs into which we had been drawn by the Peace of Tilsit We ought
not to fight either for or against Austria Our political interests are
all in the East and in regard to Bonaparte the only thing is to have an
armed frontier and a firm policy and he will never dare to cross the
Russian frontier as was the case in 1807

How can we fight the French Prince said Count Rostopchin Can we
arm ourselves against our teachers and divinities Look at our youths
look at our ladies The French are our Gods Paris is our Kingdom of
Heaven

He began speaking louder evidently to be heard by everyone

French dresses French ideas French feelings There now you turned
Metivier out by the scruff of his neck because he is a Frenchman and a
scoundrel but our ladies crawl after him on their knees I went to a
party last night and there out of five ladies three were Roman
Catholics and had the Popes indulgence for doing woolwork on Sundays
And they themselves sit there nearly naked like the signboards at our
Public Baths if I may say so Ah when one looks at our young people
Prince one would like to take Peter the Greats old cudgel out of the
museum and belabor them in the Russian way till all the nonsense jumps
out of them

All were silent The old prince looked at Rostopchin with a smile and
wagged his head approvingly

Well goodby your excellency keep well said Rostopchin getting up
with characteristic briskness and holding out his hand to the prince

Goodbye my dear fellow His words are music I never tire of
hearing him said the old prince keeping hold of the hand and offering
his cheek to be kissed

Following Rostopchins example the others also rose





CHAPTER IV

Princess Mary as she sat listening to the old mens talk and
faultfinding understood nothing of what she heard she only wondered
whether the guests had all observed her fathers hostile attitude toward
her She did not even notice the special attentions and amiabilities
shown her during dinner by Bors Drubetsky who was visiting them for
the third time already

Princess Mary turned with absentminded questioning look to Pierre who
hat in hand and with a smile on his face was the last of the guests to
approach her after the old prince had gone out and they were left alone
in the drawing room

May I stay a little longer he said letting his stout body sink into
an armchair beside her

Oh yes she answered You noticed nothing her look asked

Pierre was in an agreeable afterdinner mood He looked straight before
him and smiled quietly

Have you known that young man long Princess he asked

Who

Drubetsky

No not long

Do you like him

Yes he is an agreeable young man Why do you ask me that said
Princess Mary still thinking of that mornings conversation with her
father

Because I have noticed that when a young man comes on leave from
Petersburg to Moscow it is usually with the object of marrying an
heiress

You have observed that said Princess Mary

Yes returned Pierre with a smile and this young man now manages
matters so that where there is a wealthy heiress there he is too I can
read him like a book At present he is hesitating whom to lay siege
toyou or Mademoiselle Julie Kargina He is very attentive to her

He visits them

Yes very often And do you know the new way of courting said Pierre
with an amused smile evidently in that cheerful mood of good humored
raillery for which he so often reproached himself in his diary

No replied Princess Mary

To please Moscow girls nowadays one has to be melancholy He is very
melancholy with Mademoiselle Kargina said Pierre

Really asked Princess Mary looking into Pierres kindly face and
still thinking of her own sorrow It would be a relief thought she
if I ventured to confide what I am feeling to someone I should like to
tell everything to Pierre He is kind and generous It would be a
relief He would give me advice

Would you marry him

Oh my God Count there are moments when I would marry anybody she
cried suddenly to her own surprise and with tears in her voice Ah how
bitter it is to love someone near to you and to feel that she went
on in a trembling voice that you can do nothing for him but grieve
him and to know that you cannot alter this Then there is only one
thing leftto go away but where could I go

What is wrong What is it Princess

But without finishing what she was saying Princess Mary burst into
tears

I dont know what is the matter with me today Dont take any
noticeforget what I have said

Pierres gaiety vanished completely He anxiously questioned the
princess asked her to speak out fully and confide her grief to him but
she only repeated that she begged him to forget what she had said that
she did not remember what she had said and that she had no trouble
except the one he knew ofthat Prince Andrews marriage threatened to
cause a rupture between father and son

Have you any news of the Rostvs she asked to change the subject I
was told they are coming soon I am also expecting Andrew any day I
should like them to meet here

And how does he now regard the matter asked Pierre referring to the
old prince

Princess Mary shook her head

What is to be done In a few months the year will be up The thing is
impossible I only wish I could spare my brother the first moments I
wish they would come sooner I hope to be friends with her You have
known them a long time said Princess Mary Tell me honestly the whole
truth what sort of girl is she and what do you think of herThe real
truth because you know Andrew is risking so much doing this against his
fathers will that I should like to know

An undefined instinct told Pierre that these explanations and repeated
requests to be told the whole truth expressed illwill on the princess
part toward her future sisterinlaw and a wish that he should
disapprove of Andrews choice but in reply he said what he felt rather
than what he thought

I dont know how to answer your question he said blushing without
knowing why I really dont know what sort of girl she is I cant
analyze her at all She is enchanting but what makes her so I dont
know That is all one can say about her

Princess Mary sighed and the expression on her face said Yes thats
what I expected and feared

Is she clever she asked

Pierre considered

I think not he said and yetyes She does not deign to be
clever Oh no she is simply enchanting and that is all

Princess Mary again shook her head disapprovingly

Ah I so long to like her Tell her so if you see her before I do

I hear they are expected very soon said Pierre

Princess Mary told Pierre of her plan to become intimate with her future
sisterinlaw as soon as the Rostvs arrived and to try to accustom the
old prince to her





CHAPTER V

Bors had not succeeded in making a wealthy match in Petersburg so with
the same object in view he came to Moscow There he wavered between the
two richest heiresses Julie and Princess Mary Though Princess Mary
despite her plainness seemed to him more attractive than Julie he
without knowing why felt awkward about paying court to her When they
had last met on the old princes name day she had answered at random
all his attempts to talk sentimentally evidently not listening to what
he was saying

Julie on the contrary accepted his attentions readily though in a
manner peculiar to herself

She was twentyseven After the death of her brothers she had become
very wealthy She was by now decidedly plain but thought herself not
merely as goodlooking as before but even far more attractive She was
confirmed in this delusion by the fact that she had become a very
wealthy heiress and also by the fact that the older she grew the less
dangerous she became to men and the more freely they could associate
with her and avail themselves of her suppers soirees and the animated
company that assembled at her house without incurring any obligation A
man who would have been afraid ten years before of going every day to
the house when there was a girl of seventeen there for fear of
compromising her and committing himself would now go boldly every day
and treat her not as a marriageable girl but as a sexless acquaintance

That winter the Karagins house was the most agreeable and hospitable in
Moscow In addition to the formal evening and dinner parties a large
company chiefly of men gathered there every day supping at midnight
and staying till three in the morning Julie never missed a ball a
promenade or a play Her dresses were always of the latest fashion But
in spite of that she seemed to be disillusioned about everything and
told everyone that she did not believe either in friendship or in love
or any of the joys of life and expected peace only yonder She
adopted the tone of one who has suffered a great disappointment like a
girl who has either lost the man she loved or been cruelly deceived by
him Though nothing of the kind had happened to her she was regarded in
that light and had even herself come to believe that she had suffered
much in life This melancholy which did not prevent her amusing
herself did not hinder the young people who came to her house from
passing the time pleasantly Every visitor who came to the house paid
his tribute to the melancholy mood of the hostess and then amused
himself with society gossip dancing intellectual games and bouts
rimes which were in vogue at the Karagins Only a few of these young
men among them Bors entered more deeply into Julies melancholy and
with these she had prolonged conversations in private on the vanity of
all worldly things and to them she showed her albums filled with
mournful sketches maxims and verses

To Bors Julie was particularly gracious she regretted his early
disillusionment with life offered him such consolation of friendship as
she who had herself suffered so much could render and showed him her
album Bors sketched two trees in the album and wrote Rustic trees
your dark branches shed gloom and melancholy upon me

On another page he drew a tomb and wrote

La mort est secourable et la mort est tranquille Ah contre les
douleurs il ny a pas dautre asile

 Death gives relief and death is peaceful

Ah from suffering there is no other refuge

Julie said this was charming

There is something so enchanting in the smile of melancholy she said
to Bors repeating word for word a passage she had copied from a book
It is a ray of light in the darkness a shade between sadness and
despair showing the possibility of consolation

In reply Bors wrote these lines

Aliment de poison dune ame trop sensible Toi sans qui le bonheur me
serait impossible Tendre melancholie ah viens me consoler Viens
calmer les tourments de ma sombre retraite Et mele une douceur secrete
A ces pleurs que je sens couler

Poisonous nourishment of a too sensitive soul Thou without whom
happiness would for me be impossible Tender melancholy ah come to
console me Come to calm the torments of my gloomy retreat And mingle a
secret sweetness With these tears that I feel to be flowing

For Bors Julie played most doleful nocturnes on her harp Bors read
Poor Liza aloud to her and more than once interrupted the reading
because of the emotions that choked him Meeting at large gatherings
Julie and Bors looked on one another as the only souls who understood
one another in a world of indifferent people

Anna Mikhylovna who often visited the Karagins while playing cards
with the mother made careful inquiries as to Julies dowry she was to
have two estates in Penza and the Nizhegorod forests Anna Mikhylovna
regarded the refined sadness that united her son to the wealthy Julie
with emotion and resignation to the Divine will

You are always charming and melancholy my dear Julie she said to the
daughter Bors says his soul finds repose at your house He has
suffered so many disappointments and is so sensitive said she to the
mother Ah my dear I cant tell you how fond I have grown of Julie
latterly she said to her son But who could help loving her She is
an angelic being Ah Bors Borsshe paused And how I pity her
mother she went on today she showed me her accounts and letters from
Penza they have enormous estates there and she poor thing has no
one to help her and they do cheat her so

Bors smiled almost imperceptibly while listening to his mother He
laughed blandly at her nave diplomacy but listened to what she had to
say and sometimes questioned her carefully about the Penza and
Nizhegorod estates

Julie had long been expecting a proposal from her melancholy adorer and
was ready to accept it but some secret feeling of repulsion for her
for her passionate desire to get married for her artificiality and a
feeling of horror at renouncing the possibility of real love still
restrained Bors His leave was expiring He spent every day and whole
days at the Karagins and every day on thinking the matter over told
himself that he would propose tomorrow But in Julies presence looking
at her red face and chin nearly always powdered her moist eyes and
her expression of continual readiness to pass at once from melancholy to
an unnatural rapture of married bliss Bors could not utter the
decisive words though in imagination he had long regarded himself as
the possessor of those Penza and Nizhegorod estates and had apportioned
the use of the income from them Julie saw Bors indecision and
sometimes the thought occurred to her that she was repulsive to him but
her feminine selfdeception immediately supplied her with consolation
and she told herself that he was only shy from love Her melancholy
however began to turn to irritability and not long before Bors
departure she formed a definite plan of action Just as Bors leave of
absence was expiring Anatole Kurgin made his appearance in Moscow and
of course in the Karagins drawing room and Julie suddenly abandoning
her melancholy became cheerful and very attentive to Kurgin

My dear said Anna Mikhylovna to her son I know from a reliable
source that Prince Vasli has sent his son to Moscow to get him married
to Julie I am so fond of Julie that I should be sorry for her What do
you think of it my dear

The idea of being made a fool of and of having thrown away that whole
month of arduous melancholy service to Julie and of seeing all the
revenue from the Penza estates which he had already mentally apportioned
and put to proper use fall into the hands of another and especially
into the hands of that idiot Anatole pained Bors He drove to the
Karagins with the firm intention of proposing Julie met him in a gay
careless manner spoke casually of how she had enjoyed yesterdays ball
and asked when he was leaving Though Bors had come intentionally to
speak of his love and therefore meant to be tender he began speaking
irritably of feminine inconstancy of how easily women can turn from
sadness to joy and how their moods depend solely on who happens to be
paying court to them Julie was offended and replied that it was true
that a woman needs variety and the same thing over and over again would
weary anyone

Then I should advise you Bors began wishing to sting her but at
that instant the galling thought occurred to him that he might have to
leave Moscow without having accomplished his aim and have vainly wasted
his effortswhich was a thing he never allowed to happen

He checked himself in the middle of the sentence lowered his eyes to
avoid seeing her unpleasantly irritated and irresolute face and said

I did not come here at all to quarrel with you On the contrary

He glanced at her to make sure that he might go on Her irritability had
suddenly quite vanished and her anxious imploring eyes were fixed on
him with greedy expectation I can always arrange so as not to see her
often thought Bors The affair has been begun and must be finished
He blushed hotly raised his eyes to hers and said

You know my feelings for you

There was no need to say more Julies face shone with triumph and self
satisfaction but she forced Bors to say all that is said on such
occasionsthat he loved her and had never loved any other woman more
than her She knew that for the Penza estates and Nizhegorod forests she
could demand this and she received what she demanded

The affianced couple no longer alluding to trees that shed gloom and
melancholy upon them planned the arrangements of a splendid house in
Petersburg paid calls and prepared everything for a brilliant wedding





CHAPTER VI

At the end of January old Count Rostv went to Moscow with Natsha and
Snya The countess was still unwell and unable to travel but it was
impossible to wait for her recovery Prince Andrew was expected in
Moscow any day the trousseau had to be ordered and the estate near
Moscow had to be sold besides which the opportunity of presenting his
future daughterinlaw to old Prince Bolknski while he was in Moscow
could not be missed The Rostvs Moscow house had not been heated that
winter and as they had come only for a short time and the countess was
not with them the count decided to stay with Mrya Dmtrievna
Akhrosmova who had long been pressing her hospitality on them

Late one evening the Rostvs four sleighs drove into Mrya Dmtrievnas
courtyard in the old Konyusheny street Mrya Dmtrievna lived alone
She had already married off her daughter and her sons were all in the
service

She held herself as erect told everyone her opinion as candidly
loudly and bluntly as ever and her whole bearing seemed a reproach to
others for any weakness passion or temptationthe possibility of which
she did not admit From early in the morning wearing a dressing jacket
she attended to her household affairs and then she drove out on holy
days to church and after the service to jails and prisons on affairs of
which she never spoke to anyone On ordinary days after dressing she
received petitioners of various classes of whom there were always some
Then she had dinner a substantial and appetizing meal at which there
were always three or four guests after dinner she played a game of
boston and at night she had the newspapers or a new book read to her
while she knitted She rarely made an exception and went out to pay
visits and then only to the most important persons in the town

She had not yet gone to bed when the Rostvs arrived and the pulley of
the hall door squeaked from the cold as it let in the Rostvs and their
servants Mrya Dmtrievna with her spectacles hanging down on her nose
and her head flung back stood in the hall doorway looking with a stern
grim face at the new arrivals One might have thought she was angry with
the travelers and would immediately turn them out had she not at the
same time been giving careful instructions to the servants for the
accommodation of the visitors and their belongings

The counts things Bring them here she said pointing to the
portmanteaus and not greeting anyone The young ladies There to the
left Now what are you dawdling for she cried to the maids Get the
samovar ready Youve grown plumper and prettier she remarked
drawing Natsha whose cheeks were glowing from the cold to her by the
hood Foo You are cold Now take off your things quick she shouted
to the count who was going to kiss her hand Youre half frozen Im
sure Bring some rum for tea Bonjour Snya dear she added
turning to Snya and indicating by this French greeting her slightly
contemptuous though affectionate attitude toward her

When they came in to tea having taken off their outdoor things and
tidied themselves up after their journey Mrya Dmtrievna kissed them
all in due order

Im heartily glad you have come and are staying with me It was high
time she said giving Natsha a significant look The old man is here
and his sons expected any day Youll have to make his acquaintance
But well speak of that later on she added glancing at Snya with a
look that showed she did not want to speak of it in her presence Now
listen she said to the count What do you want tomorrow Whom will
you send for Shinshn she crooked one of her fingers The sniveling
Anna Mikhylovna Thats two Shes here with her son The son is
getting married Then Bezkhov eh He is here too with his wife He
ran away from her and she came galloping after him He dined with me on
Wednesday As for themand she pointed to the girlstomorrow Ill take
them first to the Iberian shrine of the Mother of God and then well
drive to the SuperRogues I suppose youll have everything new Dont
judge by me sleeves nowadays are this size The other day young
Princess Irina Vasilevna came to see me she was an awful sightlooked
as if she had put two barrels on her arms You know not a day passes now
without some new fashion And what have you to do yourself she
asked the count sternly

One thing has come on top of another her rags to buy and now a
purchaser has turned up for the Moscow estate and for the house If you
will be so kind Ill fix a time and go down to the estate just for a
day and leave my lassies with you

All right All right Theyll be safe with me as safe as in Chancery
Ill take them where they must go scold them a bit and pet them a
bit said Mrya Dmtrievna touching her goddaughter and favorite
Natsha on the cheek with her large hand

Next morning Mrya Dmtrievna took the young ladies to the Iberian
shrine of the Mother of God and to Madame SuppertRoguet who was so
afraid of Mrya Dmtrievna that she always let her have costumes at a
loss merely to get rid of her Mrya Dmtrievna ordered almost the whole
trousseau When they got home she turned everybody out of the room
except Natsha and then called her pet to her armchair

Well now well talk I congratulate you on your betrothed Youve
hooked a fine fellow I am glad for your sake and Ive known him since
he was so high She held her hand a couple of feet from the ground
Natsha blushed happily I like him and all his family Now listen You
know that old Prince Nicholas much dislikes his sons marrying The old
fellows crotchety Of course Prince Andrew is not a child and can shift
without him but its not nice to enter a family against a fathers
will One wants to do it peacefully and lovingly Youre a clever girl
and youll know how to manage Be kind and use your wits Then all will
be well

Natsha remained silent from shyness Mrya Dmtrievna supposed but
really because she disliked anyone interfering in what touched her love
of Prince Andrew which seemed to her so apart from all human affairs
that no one could understand it She loved and knew Prince Andrew he
loved her only and was to come one of these days and take her She
wanted nothing more

You see I have known him a long time and am also fond of Mary your
future sisterinlaw Husbands sisters bring up blisters but this
one wouldnt hurt a fly She has asked me to bring you two together
Tomorrow youll go with your father to see her Be very nice and
affectionate to her youre younger than she When he comes hell find
you already know his sister and father and are liked by them Am I right
or not Wont that be best

Yes it will Natsha answered reluctantly





CHAPTER VII

Next day by Mrya Dmtrievnas advice Count Rostv took Natsha to
call on Prince Nicholas Bolknski The count did not set out cheerfully
on this visit at heart he felt afraid He well remembered the last
interview he had had with the old prince at the time of the enrollment
when in reply to an invitation to dinner he had had to listen to an
angry reprimand for not having provided his full quota of men Natsha
on the other hand having put on her best gown was in the highest
spirits They cant help liking me she thought Everybody always has
liked me and I am so willing to do anything they wish so ready to be
fond of himfor being his fatherand of herfor being his sisterthat
there is no reason for them not to like me

They drove up to the gloomy old house on the Vozdvizhenka and entered
the vestibule

Well the Lord have mercy on us said the count half in jest half in
earnest but Natsha noticed that her father was flurried on entering
the anteroom and inquired timidly and softly whether the prince and
princess were at home

When they had been announced a perturbation was noticeable among the
servants The footman who had gone to announce them was stopped by
another in the large hall and they whispered to one another Then a
maidservant ran into the hall and hurriedly said something mentioning
the princess At last an old cross looking footman came and announced
to the Rostvs that the prince was not receiving but that the princess
begged them to walk up The first person who came to meet the visitors
was Mademoiselle Bourienne She greeted the father and daughter with
special politeness and showed them to the princess room The princess
looking excited and nervous her face flushed in patches ran in to meet
the visitors treading heavily and vainly trying to appear cordial and
at ease From the first glance Princess Mary did not like Natsha She
thought her too fashionably dressed frivolously gay and vain She did
not at all realize that before having seen her future sisterinlaw she
was prejudiced against her by involuntary envy of her beauty youth and
happiness as well as by jealousy of her brothers love for her Apart
from this insuperable antipathy to her Princess Mary was agitated just
then because on the Rostvs being announced the old prince had shouted
that he did not wish to see them that Princess Mary might do so if she
chose but they were not to be admitted to him She had decided to
receive them but feared lest the prince might at any moment indulge in
some freak as he seemed much upset by the Rostvs visit

There my dear princess Ive brought you my songstress said the
count bowing and looking round uneasily as if afraid the old prince
might appear I am so glad you should get to know one another very
sorry the prince is still ailing and after a few more commonplace
remarks he rose If youll allow me to leave my Natsha in your hands
for a quarter of an hour Princess Ill drive round to see Anna
Semnovna its quite near in the Dogs Square and then Ill come back
for her

The count had devised this diplomatic ruse as he afterwards told his
daughter to give the future sistersinlaw an opportunity to talk to
one another freely but another motive was to avoid the danger of
encountering the old prince of whom he was afraid He did not mention
this to his daughter but Natsha noticed her fathers nervousness and
anxiety and felt mortified by it She blushed for him grew still
angrier at having blushed and looked at the princess with a bold and
defiant expression which said that she was not afraid of anybody The
princess told the count that she would be delighted and only begged him
to stay longer at Anna Semnovnas and he departed

Despite the uneasy glances thrown at her by Princess Marywho wished to
have a ttette with NatshaMademoiselle Bourienne remained in the
room and persistently talked about Moscow amusements and theaters
Natsha felt offended by the hesitation she had noticed in the anteroom
by her fathers nervousness and by the unnatural manner of the princess
whoshe thoughtwas making a favor of receiving her and so everything
displeased her She did not like Princess Mary whom she thought very
plain affected and dry Natsha suddenly shrank into herself and
involuntarily assumed an offhand air which alienated Princess Mary still
more After five minutes of irksome constrained conversation they
heard the sound of slippered feet rapidly approaching Princess Mary
looked frightened

The door opened and the old prince in a dressing gown and a white
nightcap came in

Ah madam he began Madam Countess Countess Rostva if I am not
mistaken I beg you to excuse me to excuse me I did not know
madam God is my witness I did not know you had honored us with a
visit and I came in such a costume only to see my daughter I beg you
to excuse me God is my witness I didnt know he repeated
stressing the word God so unnaturally and so unpleasantly that
Princess Mary stood with downcast eyes not daring to look either at her
father or at Natsha

Nor did the latter having risen and curtsied know what to do
Mademoiselle Bourienne alone smiled agreeably

I beg you to excuse me excuse me God is my witness I did not know
muttered the old man and after looking Natsha over from head to foot
he went out

Mademoiselle Bourienne was the first to recover herself after this
apparition and began speaking about the princes indisposition Natsha
and Princess Mary looked at one another in silence and the longer they
did so without saying what they wanted to say the greater grew their
antipathy to one another

When the count returned Natsha was impolitely pleased and hastened to
get away at that moment she hated the stiff elderly princess who
could place her in such an embarrassing position and had spent half an
hour with her without once mentioning Prince Andrew I couldnt begin
talking about him in the presence of that Frenchwoman thought Natsha
The same thought was meanwhile tormenting Princess Mary She knew what
she ought to have said to Natsha but she had been unable to say it
because Mademoiselle Bourienne was in the way and because without
knowing why she felt it very difficult to speak of the marriage When
the count was already leaving the room Princess Mary went up hurriedly
to Natsha took her by the hand and said with a deep sigh

Wait I must

Natsha glanced at her ironically without knowing why

Dear Natalie said Princess Mary I want you to know that I am glad
my brother has found happiness

She paused feeling that she was not telling the truth Natsha noticed
this and guessed its reason

I think Princess it is not convenient to speak of that now she said
with external dignity and coldness though she felt the tears choking
her

What have I said and what have I done thought she as soon as she was
out of the room

They waited a long time for Natsha to come to dinner that day She sat
in her room crying like a child blowing her nose and sobbing Snya
stood beside her kissing her hair

Natsha what is it about she asked What do they matter to you It
will all pass Natsha

But if you only knew how offensive it was as if I

Dont talk about it Natsha It wasnt your fault so why should you
mind Kiss me said Snya

Natsha raised her head and kissing her friend on the lips pressed her
wet face against her

I cant tell you I dont know No ones to blame said NatshaIts
my fault But it all hurts terribly Oh why doesnt he come

She came in to dinner with red eyes Mrya Dmtrievna who knew how the
prince had received the Rostvs pretended not to notice how upset
Natsha was and jested resolutely and loudly at table with the count and
the other guests





CHAPTER VIII

That evening the Rostvs went to the Opera for which Mrya Dmtrievna
had taken a box

Natsha did not want to go but could not refuse Mrya Dmtrievnas kind
offer which was intended expressly for her When she came ready dressed
into the ballroom to await her father and looking in the large mirror
there saw that she was pretty very pretty she felt even more sad but
it was a sweet tender sadness

O God if he were here now I would not behave as I did then but
differently I would not be silly and afraid of things I would simply
embrace him cling to him and make him look at me with those searching
inquiring eyes with which he has so often looked at me and then I would
make him laugh as he used to laugh And his eyeshow I see those eyes
thought Natsha And what do his father and sister matter to me I love
him alone him him with that face and those eyes with his smile
manly and yet childlike No I had better not think of him not think
of him but forget him quite forget him for the present I cant bear
this waiting and I shall cry in a minute and she turned away from the
glass making an effort not to cry And how can Snya love Nicholas so
calmly and quietly and wait so long and so patiently thought she
looking at Snya who also came in quite ready with a fan in her hand
No shes altogether different I cant

Natsha at that moment felt so softened and tender that it was not
enough for her to love and know she was beloved she wanted now at
once to embrace the man she loved to speak and hear from him words of
love such as filled her heart While she sat in the carriage beside her
father pensively watching the lights of the street lamps flickering on
the frozen window she felt still sadder and more in love and forgot
where she was going and with whom Having fallen into the line of
carriages the Rostvs carriage drove up to the theater its wheels
squeaking over the snow Natsha and Snya holding up their dresses
jumped out quickly The count got out helped by the footmen and
passing among men and women who were entering and the program sellers
they all three went along the corridor to the first row of boxes
Through the closed doors the music was already audible

Natsha your hair whispered Snya

An attendant deferentially and quickly slipped before the ladies and
opened the door of their box The music sounded louder and through the
door rows of brightly lit boxes in which ladies sat with bare arms and
shoulders and noisy stalls brilliant with uniforms glittered before
their eyes A lady entering the next box shot a glance of feminine envy
at Natsha The curtain had not yet risen and the overture was being
played Natsha smoothing her gown went in with Snya and sat down
scanning the brilliant tiers of boxes opposite A sensation she had not
experienced for a long timethat of hundreds of eyes looking at her bare
arms and necksuddenly affected her both agreeably and disagreeably and
called up a whole crowd of memories desires and emotions associated
with that feeling

The two remarkably pretty girls Natsha and Snya with Count Rostv
who had not been seen in Moscow for a long time attracted general
attention Moreover everybody knew vaguely of Natshas engagement to
Prince Andrew and knew that the Rostvs had lived in the country ever
since and all looked with curiosity at a fiancee who was making one of
the best matches in Russia

Natshas looks as everyone told her had improved in the country and
that evening thanks to her agitation she was particularly pretty She
struck those who saw her by her fullness of life and beauty combined
with her indifference to everything about her Her black eyes looked at
the crowd without seeking anyone and her delicate arm bare to above
the elbow lay on the velvet edge of the box while evidently
unconsciously she opened and closed her hand in time to the music
crumpling her program Look theres Alenina said Snya with her
mother isnt it

Dear me Michael Kirilovich has grown still stouter remarked the
count

Look at our Anna Mikhylovnawhat a headdress she has on

The Karagins Julieand Bors with them One can see at once that
theyre engaged

Drubetsky has proposed

Oh yes I heard it today said Shinshn coming into the Rostvs box

Natsha looked in the direction in which her fathers eyes were turned
and saw Julie sitting beside her mother with a happy look on her face
and a string of pearls round her thick red neckwhich Natsha knew was
covered with powder Behind them wearing a smile and leaning over with
an ear to Julies mouth was Bors handsome smoothly brushed head He
looked at the Rostvs from under his brows and said something smiling
to his betrothed

They are talking about us about me and him thought Natsha And he
no doubt is calming her jealousy of me They neednt trouble themselves
If only they knew how little I am concerned about any of them

Behind them sat Anna Mikhylovna wearing a green headdress and with a
happy look of resignation to the will of God on her face Their box was
pervaded by that atmosphere of an affianced couple which Natsha knew so
well and liked so much She turned away and suddenly remembered all that
had been so humiliating in her mornings visit

What right has he not to wish to receive me into his family Oh better
not think of itnot till he comes back she told herself and began
looking at the faces some strange and some familiar in the stalls In
the front in the very center leaning back against the orchestra rail
stood Dlokhov in a Persian dress his curly hair brushed up into a huge
shock He stood in full view of the audience well aware that he was
attracting everyones attention yet as much at ease as though he were
in his own room Around him thronged Moscows most brilliant young men
whom he evidently dominated

The count laughing nudged the blushing Snya and pointed to her former
adorer

Do you recognize him said he And where has he sprung from he
asked turning to Shinshn Didnt he vanish somewhere

He did replied Shinshn He was in the Caucasus and ran away from
there They say he has been acting as minister to some ruling prince in
Persia where he killed the Shahs brother Now all the Moscow ladies
are mad about him Its Dlokhov the Persian that does it We never
hear a word but Dlokhov is mentioned They swear by him they offer him
to you as they would a dish of choice sterlet Dlokhov and Anatole
Kurgin have turned all our ladies heads

A tall beautiful woman with a mass of plaited hair and much exposed
plump white shoulders and neck round which she wore a double string of
large pearls entered the adjoining box rustling her heavy silk dress
and took a long time settling into her place

Natsha involuntarily gazed at that neck those shoulders and pearls
and coiffure and admired the beauty of the shoulders and the pearls
While Natsha was fixing her gaze on her for the second time the lady
looked round and meeting the counts eyes nodded to him and smiled
She was the Countess Bezkhova Pierres wife and the count who knew
everyone in society leaned over and spoke to her

Have you been here long Countess he inquired Ill call Ill call
to kiss your hand Im here on business and have brought my girls with
me They say Semnova acts marvelously Count Pierre never used to
forget us Is he here

Yes he meant to look in answered Hlne and glanced attentively at
Natsha

Count Rostv resumed his seat

Handsome isnt she he whispered to Natsha

Wonderful answered Natsha Shes a woman one could easily fall in
love with

Just then the last chords of the overture were heard and the conductor
tapped with his stick Some latecomers took their seats in the stalls
and the curtain rose

As soon as it rose everyone in the boxes and stalls became silent and
all the men old and young in uniform and evening dress and all the
women with gems on their bare flesh turned their whole attention with
eager curiosity to the stage Natsha too began to look at it





CHAPTER IX

The floor of the stage consisted of smooth boards at the sides was some
painted cardboard representing trees and at the back was a cloth
stretched over boards In the center of the stage sat some girls in red
bodices and white skirts One very fat girl in a white silk dress sat
apart on a low bench to the back of which a piece of green cardboard
was glued They all sang something When they had finished their song
the girl in white went up to the prompters box and a man with tight
silk trousers over his stout legs and holding a plume and a dagger
went up to her and began singing waving his arms about

First the man in the tight trousers sang alone then she sang then they
both paused while the orchestra played and the man fingered the hand of
the girl in white obviously awaiting the beat to start singing with
her They sang together and everyone in the theater began clapping and
shouting while the man and woman on the stagewho represented
loversbegan smiling spreading out their arms and bowing

After her life in the country and in her present serious mood all this
seemed grotesque and amazing to Natsha She could not follow the opera
nor even listen to the music she saw only the painted cardboard and the
queerly dressed men and women who moved spoke and sang so strangely in
that brilliant light She knew what it was all meant to represent but
it was so pretentiously false and unnatural that she first felt ashamed
for the actors and then amused at them She looked at the faces of the
audience seeking in them the same sense of ridicule and perplexity she
herself experienced but they all seemed attentive to what was happening
on the stage and expressed delight which to Natsha seemed feigned I
suppose it has to be like this she thought She kept looking round in
turn at the rows of pomaded heads in the stalls and then at the seminude
women in the boxes especially at Hlne in the next box whoapparently
quite unclothedsat with a quiet tranquil smile not taking her eyes off
the stage And feeling the bright light that flooded the whole place and
the warm air heated by the crowd Natsha little by little began to pass
into a state of intoxication she had not experienced for a long while
She did not realize who and where she was nor what was going on before
her As she looked and thought the strangest fancies unexpectedly and
disconnectedly passed through her mind the idea occurred to her of
jumping onto the edge of the box and singing the air the actress was
singing then she wished to touch with her fan an old gentleman sitting
not far from her then to lean over to Hlne and tickle her

At a moment when all was quiet before the commencement of a song a door
leading to the stalls on the side nearest the Rostvs box creaked and
the steps of a belated arrival were heard Theres Kurgin whispered
Shinshn Countess Bezkhova turned smiling to the newcomer and
Natsha following the direction of that look saw an exceptionally
handsome adjutant approaching their box with a selfassured yet
courteous bearing This was Anatole Kurgin whom she had seen and
noticed long ago at the ball in Petersburg He was now in an adjutants
uniform with one epaulet and a shoulder knot He moved with a restrained
swagger which would have been ridiculous had he not been so goodlooking
and had his handsome face not worn such an expression of goodhumored
complacency and gaiety Though the performance was proceeding he walked
deliberately down the carpeted gangway his sword and spurs slightly
jingling and his handsome perfumed head held high Having looked at
Natsha he approached his sister laid his well gloved hand on the edge
of her box nodded to her and leaning forward asked a question with a
motion toward Natsha

Mais charmante said he evidently referring to Natsha who did not
exactly hear his words but understood them from the movement of his
lips Then he took his place in the first row of the stalls and sat down
beside Dlokhov nudging with his elbow in a friendly and offhand way
that Dlokhov whom others treated so fawningly He winked at him gaily
smiled and rested his foot against the orchestra screen

How like the brother is to the sister remarked the count And how
handsome they both are

Shinshn lowering his voice began to tell the count of some intrigue
of Kurgins in Moscow and Natsha tried to overhear it just because he
had said she was charmante

The first act was over In the stalls everyone began moving about going
out and coming in

Bors came to the Rostvs box received their congratulations very
simply and raising his eyebrows with an absentminded smile conveyed to
Natsha and Snya his fiancees invitation to her wedding and went
away Natsha with a gay coquettish smile talked to him and
congratulated on his approaching wedding that same Bors with whom she
had formerly been in love In the state of intoxication she was in
everything seemed simple and natural

The scantily clad Hlne smiled at everyone in the same way and Natsha
gave Bors a similar smile

Hlnes box was filled and surrounded from the stalls by the most
distinguished and intellectual men who seemed to vie with one another
in their wish to let everyone see that they knew her

During the whole of that entracte Kurgin stood with Dlokhov in front
of the orchestra partition looking at the Rostvs box Natsha knew he
was talking about her and this afforded her pleasure She even turned so
that he should see her profile in what she thought was its most becoming
aspect Before the beginning of the second act Pierre appeared in the
stalls The Rostvs had not seen him since their arrival His face
looked sad and he had grown still stouter since Natsha last saw him
He passed up to the front rows not noticing anyone Anatole went up to
him and began speaking to him looking at and indicating the Rostvs
box On seeing Natsha Pierre grew animated and hastily passing between
the rows came toward their box When he got there he leaned on his
elbows and smiling talked to her for a long time While conversing
with Pierre Natsha heard a mans voice in Countess Bezkhovas box and
something told her it was Kurgin She turned and their eyes met Almost
smiling he gazed straight into her eyes with such an enraptured
caressing look that it seemed strange to be so near him to look at him
like that to be so sure he admired her and not to be acquainted with
him

In the second act there was scenery representing tombstones there was a
round hole in the canvas to represent the moon shades were raised over
the footlights and from horns and contrabass came deep notes while many
people appeared from right and left wearing black cloaks and holding
things like daggers in their hands They began waving their arms Then
some other people ran in and began dragging away the maiden who had been
in white and was now in light blue They did not drag her away at once
but sang with her for a long time and then at last dragged her off and
behind the scenes something metallic was struck three times and everyone
knelt down and sang a prayer All these things were repeatedly
interrupted by the enthusiastic shouts of the audience

During this act every time Natsha looked toward the stalls she saw
Anatole Kurgin with an arm thrown across the back of his chair staring
at her She was pleased to see that he was captivated by her and it did
not occur to her that there was anything wrong in it

When the second act was over Countess Bezkhova rose turned to the
Rostvs boxher whole bosom completely exposedbeckoned the old count
with a gloved finger and paying no attention to those who had entered
her box began talking to him with an amiable smile

Do make me acquainted with your charming daughters said she The
whole town is singing their praises and I dont even know them

Natsha rose and curtsied to the splendid countess She was so pleased
by praise from this brilliant beauty that she blushed with pleasure

I want to become a Moscovite too now said Hlne How is it youre
not ashamed to bury such pearls in the country

Countess Bezkhova quite deserved her reputation of being a fascinating
woman She could say what she did not thinkespecially what was
flatteringquite simply and naturally

Dear count you must let me look after your daughters Though I am not
staying here long this timenor are youI will try to amuse them I have
already heard much of you in Petersburg and wanted to get to know you
said she to Natsha with her stereotyped and lovely smile I had heard
about you from my page Drubetsky Have you heard he is getting
married And also from my husbands friend Bolknski Prince Andrew
Bolknski she went on with special emphasis implying that she knew of
his relation to Natsha To get better acquainted she asked that one of
the young ladies should come into her box for the rest of the
performance and Natsha moved over to it

The scene of the third act represented a palace in which many candles
were burning and pictures of knights with short beards hung on the
walls In the middle stood what were probably a king and a queen The
king waved his right arm and evidently nervous sang something badly
and sat down on a crimson throne The maiden who had been first in white
and then in light blue now wore only a smock and stood beside the
throne with her hair down She sang something mournfully addressing the
queen but the king waved his arm severely and men and women with bare
legs came in from both sides and began dancing all together Then the
violins played very shrilly and merrily and one of the women with thick
bare legs and thin arms separating from the others went behind the
wings adjusted her bodice returned to the middle of the stage and
began jumping and striking one foot rapidly against the other In the
stalls everyone clapped and shouted bravo Then one of the men went
into a corner of the stage The cymbals and horns in the orchestra
struck up more loudly and this man with bare legs jumped very high and
waved his feet about very rapidly He was Duport who received sixty
thousand rubles a year for this art Everybody in the stalls boxes
and galleries began clapping and shouting with all their might and the
man stopped and began smiling and bowing to all sides Then other men
and women danced with bare legs Then the king again shouted to the
sound of music and they all began singing But suddenly a storm came
on chromatic scales and diminished sevenths were heard in the
orchestra everyone ran off again dragging one of their number away
and the curtain dropped Once more there was a terrible noise and
clatter among the audience and with rapturous faces everyone began
shouting Duport Duport Duport Natsha no longer thought this
strange She looked about with pleasure smiling joyfully

Isnt Duport delightful Hlne asked her

Oh yes replied Natsha





CHAPTER X

During the entracte a whiff of cold air came into Hlnes box the
door opened and Anatole entered stooping and trying not to brush
against anyone

Let me introduce my brother to you said Hlne her eyes shifting
uneasily from Natsha to Anatole

Natsha turned her pretty little head toward the elegant young officer
and smiled at him over her bare shoulder Anatole who was as handsome
at close quarters as at a distance sat down beside her and told her he
had long wished to have this happinessever since the Naryshkins ball
in fact at which he had had the wellremembered pleasure of seeing her
Kurgin was much more sensible and simple with women than among men He
talked boldly and naturally and Natsha was strangely and agreeably
struck by the fact that there was nothing formidable in this man about
whom there was so much talk but that on the contrary his smile was most
nave cheerful and goodnatured

Kurgin asked her opinion of the performance and told her how at a
previous performance Semnova had fallen down on the stage

And do you know Countess he said suddenly addressing her as an old
familiar acquaintance we are getting up a costume tournament you
ought to take part in it It will be great fun We shall all meet at the
Karagins Please come No Really eh said he

While saying this he never removed his smiling eyes from her face her
neck and her bare arms Natsha knew for certain that he was enraptured
by her This pleased her yet his presence made her feel constrained and
oppressed When she was not looking at him she felt that he was looking
at her shoulders and she involuntarily caught his eye so that he should
look into hers rather than this But looking into his eyes she was
frightened realizing that there was not that barrier of modesty she had
always felt between herself and other men She did not know how it was
that within five minutes she had come to feel herself terribly near to
this man When she turned away she feared he might seize her from behind
by her bare arm and kiss her on the neck They spoke of most ordinary
things yet she felt that they were closer to one another than she had
ever been to any man Natsha kept turning to Hlne and to her father
as if asking what it all meant but Hlne was engaged in conversation
with a general and did not answer her look and her fathers eyes said
nothing but what they always said Having a good time Well Im glad
of it

During one of these moments of awkward silence when Anatoles prominent
eyes were gazing calmly and fixedly at her Natsha to break the
silence asked him how he liked Moscow She asked the question and
blushed She felt all the time that by talking to him she was doing
something improper Anatole smiled as though to encourage her

At first I did not like it much because what makes a town pleasant ce
sont les jolies femmes isnt that so But now I like it very much
indeed he said looking at her significantly Youll come to the
costume tournament Countess Do come and putting out his hand to her
bouquet and dropping his voice he added You will be the prettiest
there Do come dear countess and give me this flower as a pledge

 Are the pretty women

Natsha did not understand what he was saying any more than he did
himself but she felt that his incomprehensible words had an improper
intention She did not know what to say and turned away as if she had
not heard his remark But as soon as she had turned away she felt that
he was there behind so close behind her

How is he now Confused Angry Ought I to put it right she asked
herself and she could not refrain from turning round She looked
straight into his eyes and his nearness selfassurance and the good
natured tenderness of his smile vanquished her She smiled just as he
was doing gazing straight into his eyes And again she felt with horror
that no barrier lay between him and her

The curtain rose again Anatole left the box serene and gay Natsha
went back to her father in the other box now quite submissive to the
world she found herself in All that was going on before her now seemed
quite natural but on the other hand all her previous thoughts of her
betrothed of Princess Mary or of life in the country did not once
recur to her mind and were as if belonging to a remote past

In the fourth act there was some sort of devil who sang waving his arm
about till the boards were withdrawn from under him and he disappeared
down below That was the only part of the fourth act that Natsha saw
She felt agitated and tormented and the cause of this was Kurgin whom
she could not help watching As they were leaving the theater Anatole
came up to them called their carriage and helped them in As he was
putting Natsha in he pressed her arm above the elbow Agitated and
flushed she turned round He was looking at her with glittering eyes
smiling tenderly

Only after she had reached home was Natsha able clearly to think over
what had happened to her and suddenly remembering Prince Andrew she was
horrified and at tea to which all had sat down after the opera she
gave a loud exclamation flushed and ran out of the room

O God I am lost she said to herself How could I let him She sat
for a long time hiding her flushed face in her hands trying to realize
what had happened to her but was unable either to understand what had
happened or what she felt Everything seemed dark obscure and
terrible There in that enormous illuminated theater where the bare
legged Duport in a tinseldecorated jacket jumped about to the music
on wet boards and young girls and old men and the nearly naked Hlne
with her proud calm smile rapturously cried bravothere in the
presence of that Hlne it had all seemed clear and simple but now
alone by herself it was incomprehensible What is it What was that
terror I felt of him What is this gnawing of conscience I am feeling
now she thought

Only to the old countess at night in bed could Natsha have told all she
was feeling She knew that Snya with her severe and simple views would
either not understand it at all or would be horrified at such a
confession So Natsha tried to solve what was torturing her by herself

Am I spoiled for Andrews love or not she asked herself and with
soothing irony replied What a fool I am to ask that What did happen
to me Nothing I have done nothing I didnt lead him on at all Nobody
will know and I shall never see him again she told herself So it is
plain that nothing has happened and there is nothing to repent of and
Andrew can love me still But why still O God why isnt he here
Natsha quieted herself for a moment but again some instinct told her
that though all this was true and though nothing had happened yet the
former purity of her love for Prince Andrew had perished And again in
imagination she went over her whole conversation with Kurgin and again
saw the face gestures and tender smile of that bold handsome man when
he pressed her arm





CHAPTER XI

Anatole Kurgin was staying in Moscow because his father had sent him
away from Petersburg where he had been spending twenty thousand rubles
a year in cash besides running up debts for as much more which his
creditors demanded from his father

His father announced to him that he would now pay half his debts for the
last time but only on condition that he went to Moscow as adjutant to
the commanderinchiefa post his father had procured for himand would
at last try to make a good match there He indicated to him Princess
Mary and Julie Kargina

Anatole consented and went to Moscow where he put up at Pierres house
Pierre received him unwillingly at first but got used to him after a
while sometimes even accompanied him on his carousals and gave him
money under the guise of loans

As Shinshn had remarked from the time of his arrival Anatole had
turned the heads of the Moscow ladies especially by the fact that he
slighted them and plainly preferred the gypsy girls and French
actresseswith the chief of whom Mademoiselle George he was said to be
on intimate relations He had never missed a carousal at Danilovs or
other Moscow revelers drank whole nights through outvying everyone
else and was at all the balls and parties of the best society There
was talk of his intrigues with some of the ladies and he flirted with a
few of them at the balls But he did not run after the unmarried girls
especially the rich heiresses who were most of them plain There was a
special reason for this as he had got married two years beforea fact
known only to his most intimate friends At that time while with his
regiment in Poland a Polish landowner of small means had forced him to
marry his daughter Anatole had very soon abandoned his wife and for a
payment which he agreed to send to his fatherinlaw had arranged to be
free to pass himself off as a bachelor

Anatole was always content with his position with himself and with
others He was instinctively and thoroughly convinced that it was
impossible for him to live otherwise than as he did and that he had
never in his life done anything base He was incapable of considering
how his actions might affect others or what the consequences of this or
that action of his might be He was convinced that as a duck is so made
that it must live in water so God had made him such that he must spend
thirty thousand rubles a year and always occupy a prominent position in
society He believed this so firmly that others looking at him were
persuaded of it too and did not refuse him either a leading place in
society or money which he borrowed from anyone and everyone and
evidently would not repay

He was not a gambler at any rate he did not care about winning He was
not vain He did not mind what people thought of him Still less could
he be accused of ambition More than once he had vexed his father by
spoiling his own career and he laughed at distinctions of all kinds He
was not mean and did not refuse anyone who asked of him All he cared
about was gaiety and women and as according to his ideas there was
nothing dishonorable in these tastes and he was incapable of
considering what the gratification of his tastes entailed for others he
honestly considered himself irreproachable sincerely despised rogues
and bad people and with a tranquil conscience carried his head high

Rakes those male Magdalenes have a secret feeling of innocence similar
to that which female Magdalenes have based on the same hope of
forgiveness All will be forgiven her for she loved much and all will
be forgiven him for he enjoyed much

Dlokhov who had reappeared that year in Moscow after his exile and his
Persian adventures and was leading a life of luxury gambling and
dissipation associated with his old Petersburg comrade Kurgin and made
use of him for his own ends

Anatole was sincerely fond of Dlokhov for his cleverness and audacity
Dlokhov who needed Anatole Kurgins name position and connections
as a bait to draw rich young men into his gambling set made use of him
and amused himself at his expense without letting the other feel it
Apart from the advantage he derived from Anatole the very process of
dominating anothers will was in itself a pleasure a habit and a
necessity to Dlokhov

Natsha had made a strong impression on Kurgin At supper after the
opera he described to Dlokhov with the air of a connoisseur the
attractions of her arms shoulders feet and hair and expressed his
intention of making love to her Anatole had no notion and was incapable
of considering what might come of such lovemaking as he never had any
notion of the outcome of any of his actions

Shes firstrate my dear fellow but not for us replied Dlokhov

I will tell my sister to ask her to dinner said Anatole Eh

Youd better wait till shes married

You know I adore little girls they lose their heads at once pursued
Anatole

You have been caught once already by a little girl said Dlokhov
who knew of Kurgins marriage Take care

Well that cant happen twice Eh said Anatole with a goodhumored
laugh





CHAPTER XII

The day after the opera the Rostvs went nowhere and nobody came to see
them Mrya Dmtrievna talked to the count about something which they
concealed from Natsha Natsha guessed they were talking about the old
prince and planning something and this disquieted and offended her She
was expecting Prince Andrew any moment and twice that day sent a
manservant to the Vozdvizhenka to ascertain whether he had come He had
not arrived She suffered more now than during her first days in Moscow
To her impatience and pining for him were now added the unpleasant
recollection of her interview with Princess Mary and the old prince and
a fear and anxiety of which she did not understand the cause She
continually fancied that either he would never come or that something
would happen to her before he came She could no longer think of him by
herself calmly and continuously as she had done before As soon as she
began to think of him the recollection of the old prince of Princess
Mary of the theater and of Kurgin mingled with her thoughts The
question again presented itself whether she was not guilty whether she
had not already broken faith with Prince Andrew and again she found
herself recalling to the minutest detail every word every gesture and
every shade in the play of expression on the face of the man who had
been able to arouse in her such an incomprehensible and terrifying
feeling To the family Natsha seemed livelier than usual but she was
far less tranquil and happy than before

On Sunday morning Mrya Dmtrievna invited her visitors to Mass at her
parish churchthe Church of the Assumption built over the graves of
victims of the plague

I dont like those fashionable churches she said evidently priding
herself on her independence of thought God is the same everywhere We
have an excellent priest he conducts the service decently and with
dignity and the deacon is the same What holiness is there in giving
concerts in the choir I dont like it its just selfindulgence

Mrya Dmtrievna liked Sundays and knew how to keep them Her whole
house was scrubbed and cleaned on Saturdays neither she nor the
servants worked and they all wore holiday dress and went to church At
her table there were extra dishes at dinner and the servants had vodka
and roast goose or suckling pig But in nothing in the house was the
holiday so noticeable as in Mrya Dmtrievnas broad stern face which
on that day wore an invariable look of solemn festivity

After Mass when they had finished their coffee in the dining room where
the loose covers had been removed from the furniture a servant
announced that the carriage was ready and Mrya Dmtrievna rose with a
stern air She wore her holiday shawl in which she paid calls and
announced that she was going to see Prince Nicholas Bolknski to have an
explanation with him about Natsha

After she had gone a dressmaker from Madame SuppertRoguet waited on
the Rostvs and Natsha very glad of this diversion having shut
herself into a room adjoining the drawing room occupied herself trying
on the new dresses Just as she had put on a bodice without sleeves and
only tacked together and was turning her head to see in the glass how
the back fitted she heard in the drawing room the animated sounds of
her fathers voice and anothersa womansthat made her flush It was
Hlne Natsha had not time to take off the bodice before the door
opened and Countess Bezkhova dressed in a purple velvet gown with a
high collar came into the room beaming with goodhumored amiable
smiles

Oh my enchantress she cried to the blushing Natsha Charming No
this is really beyond anything my dear count said she to Count Rostv
who had followed her in How can you live in Moscow and go nowhere No
I wont let you off Mademoiselle George will recite at my house tonight
and therell be some people and if you dont bring your lovely
girlswho are prettier than Mademoiselle GeorgeI wont know you My
husband is away in Tver or I would send him to fetch you You must come
You positively must Between eight and nine

She nodded to the dressmaker whom she knew and who had curtsied
respectfully to her and seated herself in an armchair beside the
looking glass draping the folds of her velvet dress picturesquely She
did not cease chattering goodnaturedly and gaily continually praising
Natshas beauty She looked at Natshas dresses and praised them as
well as a new dress of her own made of metallic gauze which she had
received from Paris and advised Natsha to have one like it

But anything suits you my charmer she remarked

A smile of pleasure never left Natshas face She felt happy and as if
she were blossoming under the praise of this dear Countess Bezkhova who
had formerly seemed to her so unapproachable and important and was now
so kind to her Natsha brightened up and felt almost in love with this
woman who was so beautiful and so kind Hlne for her part was
sincerely delighted with Natsha and wished to give her a good time
Anatole had asked her to bring him and Natsha together and she was
calling on the Rostvs for that purpose The idea of throwing her
brother and Natsha together amused her

Though at one time in Petersburg she had been annoyed with Natsha for
drawing Bors away she did not think of that now and in her own way
heartily wished Natsha well As she was leaving the Rostvs she called
her protegee aside

My brother dined with me yesterdaywe nearly died of laughterhe ate
nothing and kept sighing for you my charmer He is madly quite madly
in love with you my dear

Natsha blushed scarlet when she heard this

How she blushes how she blushes my pretty said Hlne You must
certainly come If you love somebody my charmer that is not a reason
to shut yourself up Even if you are engaged I am sure your fiance
would wish you to go into society rather than be bored to death

So she knows I am engaged and she and her husband Pierrethat good
Pierrehave talked and laughed about this So its all right And
again under Hlnes influence what had seemed terrible now seemed
simple and natural And she is such a grande dame so kind and
evidently likes me so much And why not enjoy myself thought Natsha
gazing at Hlne with wideopen wondering eyes

Mrya Dmtrievna came back to dinner taciturn and serious having
evidently suffered a defeat at the old princes She was still too
agitated by the encounter to be able to talk of the affair calmly In
answer to the counts inquiries she replied that things were all right
and that she would tell about it next day On hearing of Countess
Bezkhovas visit and the invitation for that evening Mrya Dmtrievna
remarked

I dont care to have anything to do with Bezkhova and dont advise you
to however if youve promisedgo It will divert your thoughts she
added addressing Natsha





CHAPTER XIII

Count Rostv took the girls to Countess Bezkhovas There were a good
many people there but nearly all strangers to Natsha Count Rostv was
displeased to see that the company consisted almost entirely of men and
women known for the freedom of their conduct Mademoiselle George was
standing in a corner of the drawing room surrounded by young men There
were several Frenchmen present among them Metivier who from the time
Hlne reached Moscow had been an intimate in her house The count
decided not to sit down to cards or let his girls out of his sight and
to get away as soon as Mademoiselle Georges performance was over

Anatole was at the door evidently on the lookout for the Rostvs
Immediately after greeting the count he went up to Natsha and followed
her As soon as she saw him she was seized by the same feeling she had
had at the operagratified vanity at his admiration of her and fear at
the absence of a moral barrier between them

Hlne welcomed Natsha delightedly and was loud in admiration of her
beauty and her dress Soon after their arrival Mademoiselle George went
out of the room to change her costume In the drawing room people began
arranging the chairs and taking their seats Anatole moved a chair for
Natsha and was about to sit down beside her but the count who never
lost sight of her took the seat himself Anatole sat down behind her

Mademoiselle George with her bare fat dimpled arms and a red shawl
draped over one shoulder came into the space left vacant for her and
assumed an unnatural pose Enthusiastic whispering was audible

Mademoiselle George looked sternly and gloomily at the audience and
began reciting some French verses describing her guilty love for her
son In some places she raised her voice in others she whispered
lifting her head triumphantly sometimes she paused and uttered hoarse
sounds rolling her eyes

Adorable divine delicious was heard from every side

Natsha looked at the fat actress but neither saw nor heard nor
understood anything of what went on before her She only felt herself
again completely borne away into this strange senseless worldso remote
from her old worlda world in which it was impossible to know what was
good or bad reasonable or senseless Behind her sat Anatole and
conscious of his proximity she experienced a frightened sense of
expectancy

After the first monologue the whole company rose and surrounded
Mademoiselle George expressing their enthusiasm

How beautiful she is Natsha remarked to her father who had also
risen and was moving through the crowd toward the actress

I dont think so when I look at you said Anatole following Natsha
He said this at a moment when she alone could hear him You are
enchanting from the moment I saw you I have never ceased

Come come Natsha said the count as he turned back for his
daughter How beautiful she is Natsha without saying anything
stepped up to her father and looked at him with surprised inquiring
eyes

After giving several recitations Mademoiselle George left and Countess
Bezkhova asked her visitors into the ballroom

The count wished to go home but Hlne entreated him not to spoil her
improvised ball and the Rostvs stayed on Anatole asked Natsha for a
valse and as they danced he pressed her waist and hand and told her she
was bewitching and that he loved her During the ecossaise which she
also danced with him Anatole said nothing when they happened to be by
themselves but merely gazed at her Natsha lifted her frightened eyes
to him but there was such confident tenderness in his affectionate look
and smile that she could not whilst looking at him say what she had to
say She lowered her eyes

Dont say such things to me I am betrothed and love another she said
rapidly She glanced at him

Anatole was not upset or pained by what she had said

Dont speak to me of that What can I do said he I tell you I am
madly madly in love with you Is it my fault that you are
enchanting Its our turn to begin

Natsha animated and excited looked about her with wideopen
frightened eyes and seemed merrier than usual She understood hardly
anything that went on that evening They danced the ecossaise and the
Grossvater Her father asked her to come home but she begged to remain
Wherever she went and whomever she was speaking to she felt his eyes
upon her Later on she recalled how she had asked her father to let her
go to the dressing room to rearrange her dress that Hlne had followed
her and spoken laughingly of her brothers love and that she again met
Anatole in the little sitting room Hlne had disappeared leaving them
alone and Anatole had taken her hand and said in a tender voice

I cannot come to visit you but is it possible that I shall never see
you I love you madly Can I never and blocking her path he
brought his face close to hers

His large glittering masculine eyes were so close to hers that she saw
nothing but them

Natalie he whispered inquiringly while she felt her hands being
painfully pressed Natalie

I dont understand I have nothing to say her eyes replied

Burning lips were pressed to hers and at the same instant she felt
herself released and Hlnes footsteps and the rustle of her dress
were heard in the room Natsha looked round at her and then red and
trembling threw a frightened look of inquiry at Anatole and moved
toward the door

One word just one for Gods sake cried Anatole

She paused She so wanted a word from him that would explain to her what
had happened and to which she could find no answer

Natalie just a word only one he kept repeating evidently not
knowing what to say and he repeated it till Hlne came up to them

Hlne returned with Natsha to the drawing room The Rostvs went away
without staying for supper

After reaching home Natsha did not sleep all night She was tormented
by the insoluble question whether she loved Anatole or Prince Andrew
She loved Prince Andrewshe remembered distinctly how deeply she loved
him But she also loved Anatole of that there was no doubt Else how
could all this have happened thought she If after that I could
return his smile when saying goodby if I was able to let it come to
that it means that I loved him from the first It means that he is
kind noble and splendid and I could not help loving him What am I to
do if I love him and the other one too she asked herself unable to
find an answer to these terrible questions





CHAPTER XIV

Morning came with its cares and bustle Everyone got up and began to
move about and talk dressmakers came again Mrya Dmtrievna appeared
and they were called to breakfast Natsha kept looking uneasily at
everybody with wideopen eyes as if wishing to intercept every glance
directed toward her and tried to appear the same as usual

After breakfast which was her best time Mrya Dmtrievna sat down in
her armchair and called Natsha and the count to her

Well friends I have now thought the whole matter over and this is my
advice she began Yesterday as you know I went to see Prince
Bolknski Well I had a talk with him He took it into his head to
begin shouting but I am not one to be shouted down I said what I had
to say

Well and he asked the count

He Hes crazy he did not want to listen But whats the use of
talking As it is we have worn the poor girl out said Mrya
Dmtrievna My advice to you is finish your business and go back home
to Otradnoe and wait there

Oh no exclaimed Natsha

Yes go back said Mrya Dmtrievna and wait there If your
betrothed comes here nowthere will be no avoiding a quarrel but alone
with the old man he will talk things over and then come on to you

Count Rostv approved of this suggestion appreciating its
reasonableness If the old man came round it would be all the better to
visit him in Moscow or at Bald Hills later on and if not the wedding
against his wishes could only be arranged at Otradnoe

That is perfectly true And I am sorry I went to see him and took her
said the old count

No why be sorry Being here you had to pay your respects But if he
wontthats his affair said Mrya Dmtrievna looking for something
in her reticule Besides the trousseau is ready so there is nothing
to wait for and what is not ready Ill send after you Though I dont
like letting you go it is the best way So go with Gods blessing

Having found what she was looking for in the reticule she handed it to
Natsha It was a letter from Princess Mary

She has written to you How she torments herself poor thing Shes
afraid you might think that she does not like you

But she doesnt like me said Natsha

Dont talk nonsense cried Mrya Dmtrievna

I shant believe anyone I know she doesnt like me replied Natsha
boldly as she took the letter and her face expressed a cold and angry
resolution that caused Mrya Dmtrievna to look at her more intently and
to frown

Dont answer like that my good girl she said What I say is true
Write an answer Natsha did not reply and went to her own room to read
Princess Marys letter

Princess Mary wrote that she was in despair at the misunderstanding that
had occurred between them Whatever her fathers feelings might be she
begged Natsha to believe that she could not help loving her as the one
chosen by her brother for whose happiness she was ready to sacrifice
everything

Do not think however she wrote that my father is illdisposed
toward you He is an invalid and an old man who must be forgiven but he
is good and magnanimous and will love her who makes his son happy
Princess Mary went on to ask Natsha to fix a time when she could see
her again

After reading the letter Natsha sat down at the writing table to answer
it Dear Princess she wrote in French quickly and mechanically and
then paused What more could she write after all that had happened the
evening before Yes yes All that has happened and now all is
changed she thought as she sat with the letter she had begun before
her Must I break off with him Must I really Thats awful and to
escape from these dreadful thoughts she went to Snya and began sorting
patterns with her

After dinner Natsha went to her room and again took up Princess Marys
letter Can it be that it is all over she thought Can it be that
all this has happened so quickly and has destroyed all that went
before She recalled her love for Prince Andrew in all its former
strength and at the same time felt that she loved Kurgin She vividly
pictured herself as Prince Andrews wife and the scenes of happiness
with him she had so often repeated in her imagination and at the same
time aglow with excitement recalled every detail of yesterdays
interview with Anatole

Why could that not be as well she sometimes asked herself in complete
bewilderment Only so could I be completely happy but now I have to
choose and I cant be happy without either of them Only she thought
to tell Prince Andrew what has happened or to hide it from him are both
equally impossible But with that one nothing is spoiled But am I
really to abandon forever the joy of Prince Andrews love in which I
have lived so long

Please Miss whispered a maid entering the room with a mysterious
air A man told me to give you this and she handed Natsha a letter

Only for Christs sake the girl went on as Natsha without
thinking mechanically broke the seal and read a love letter from
Anatole of which without taking in a word she understood only that it
was a letter from himfrom the man she loved Yes she loved him or
else how could that have happened which had happened And how could she
have a love letter from him in her hand

With trembling hands Natsha held that passionate love letter which
Dlokhov had composed for Anatole and as she read it she found in it an
echo of all that she herself imagined she was feeling

Since yesterday evening my fate has been sealed to be loved by you or
to die There is no other way for me the letter began Then he went on
to say that he knew her parents would not give her to himfor this there
were secret reasons he could reveal only to herbut that if she loved
him she need only say the word yes and no human power could hinder
their bliss Love would conquer all He would steal her away and carry
her off to the ends of the earth

Yes yes I love him thought Natsha reading the letter for the
twentieth time and finding some peculiarly deep meaning in each word of
it

That evening Mrya Dmtrievna was going to the Akharovs and proposed to
take the girls with her Natsha pleading a headache remained at home

On returning late in the evening Snya went to Natshas room and to
her surprise found her still dressed and asleep on the sofa Open on the
table beside her lay Anatoles letter Snya picked it up and read it

As she read she glanced at the sleeping Natsha trying to find in her
face an explanation of what she was reading but did not find it Her
face was calm gentle and happy Clutching her breast to keep herself
from choking Snya pale and trembling with fear and agitation sat
down in an armchair and burst into tears

How was it I noticed nothing How could it go so far Can she have left
off loving Prince Andrew And how could she let Kurgin go to such
lengths He is a deceiver and a villain thats plain What will
Nicholas dear noble Nicholas do when he hears of it So this is the
meaning of her excited resolute unnatural look the day before
yesterday yesterday and today thought Snya But it cant be that
she loves him She probably opened the letter without knowing who it was
from Probably she is offended by it She could not do such a thing

Snya wiped away her tears and went up to Natsha again scanning her
face

Natsha she said just audibly

Natsha awoke and saw Snya

Ah youre back

And with the decision and tenderness that often come at the moment of
awakening she embraced her friend but noticing Snyas look of
embarrassment her own face expressed confusion and suspicion

Snya youve read that letter she demanded

Yes answered Snya softly

Natsha smiled rapturously

No Snya I cant any longer she said I cant hide it from you any
longer You know we love one another Snya darling he writes
Snya

Snya stared openeyed at Natsha unable to believe her ears

And Bolknski she asked

Ah Snya if you only knew how happy I am cried Natsha You dont
know what love is

But Natsha can that be all over

Natsha looked at Snya with wideopen eyes as if she could not grasp
the question

Well then are you refusing Prince Andrew said Snya

Oh you dont understand anything Dont talk nonsense just listen
said Natsha with momentary vexation

But I cant believe it insisted Snya I dont understand How is it
you have loved a man for a whole year and suddenly Why you have only
seen him three times Natsha I dont believe you youre joking In
three days to forget everything and so

Three days said Natsha It seems to me Ive loved him a hundred
years It seems to me that I have never loved anyone before You cant
understand it Snya wait a bit sit here and Natsha embraced and
kissed her

I had heard that it happens like this and you must have heard it too
but its only now that I feel such love Its not the same as before As
soon as I saw him I felt he was my master and I his slave and that I
could not help loving him Yes his slave Whatever he orders I shall
do You dont understand that What can I do What can I do Snya
cried Natsha with a happy yet frightened expression

But think what you are doing cried Snya I cant leave it like
this This secret correspondence How could you let him go so far
she went on with a horror and disgust she could hardly conceal

I told you that I have no will Natsha replied Why cant you
understand I love him

Then I wont let it come to that I shall tell cried Snya
bursting into tears

What do you mean For Gods sake If you tell you are my enemy
declared Natsha You want me to be miserable you want us to be
separated

When she saw Natshas fright Snya shed tears of shame and pity for
her friend

But what has happened between you she asked What has he said to
you Why doesnt he come to the house

Natsha did not answer her questions

For Gods sake Snya dont tell anyone dont torture me Natsha
entreated Remember no one ought to interfere in such matters I have
confided in you

But why this secrecy Why doesnt he come to the house asked Snya
Why doesnt he openly ask for your hand You know Prince Andrew gave
you complete freedomif it is really so but I dont believe it
Natsha have you considered what these secret reasons can be

Natsha looked at Snya with astonishment Evidently this question
presented itself to her mind for the first time and she did not know how
to answer it

I dont know what the reasons are But there must be reasons

Snya sighed and shook her head incredulously

If there were reasons she began

But Natsha guessing her doubts interrupted her in alarm

Snya one cant doubt him One cant one cant Dont you
understand she cried

Does he love you

Does he love me Natsha repeated with a smile of pity at her friends
lack of comprehension Why you have read his letter and you have seen
him

But if he is dishonorable

He dishonorable If you only knew exclaimed Natsha

If he is an honorable man he should either declare his intentions or
cease seeing you and if you wont do this I will I will write to him
and I will tell Papa said Snya resolutely

But I cant live without him cried Natsha

Natsha I dont understand you And what are you saying Think of your
father and of Nicholas

I dont want anyone I dont love anyone but him How dare you say he
is dishonorable Dont you know that I love him screamed Natsha Go
away Snya I dont want to quarrel with you but go for Gods sake
go You see how I am suffering Natsha cried angrily in a voice of
despair and repressed irritation Snya burst into sobs and ran from the
room

Natsha went to the table and without a moments reflection wrote that
answer to Princess Mary which she had been unable to write all the
morning In this letter she said briefly that all their
misunderstandings were at an end that availing herself of the
magnanimity of Prince Andrew who when he went abroad had given her her
freedom she begged Princess Mary to forget everything and forgive her
if she had been to blame toward her but that she could not be his wife
At that moment this all seemed quite easy simple and clear to Natsha

On Friday the Rostvs were to return to the country but on Wednesday
the count went with the prospective purchaser to his estate near Moscow

On the day the count left Snya and Natsha were invited to a big
dinner party at the Karagins and Mrya Dmtrievna took them there At
that party Natsha again met Anatole and Snya noticed that she spoke
to him trying not to be overheard and that all through dinner she was
more agitated than ever When they got home Natsha was the first to
begin the explanation Snya expected

There Snya you were talking all sorts of nonsense about him
Natsha began in a mild voice such as children use when they wish to be
praised We have had an explanation today

Well what happened What did he say Natsha how glad I am youre not
angry with me Tell me everythingthe whole truth What did he say

Natsha became thoughtful

Oh Snya if you knew him as I do He said He asked me what I had
promised Bolknski He was glad I was free to refuse him

Snya sighed sorrowfully

But you havent refused Bolknski said she

Perhaps I have Perhaps all is over between me and Bolknski Why do
you think so badly of me

I dont think anything only I dont understand this

Wait a bit Snya youll understand everything Youll see what a man
he is Now dont think badly of me or of him I dont think badly of
anyone I love and pity everybody But what am I to do

Snya did not succumb to the tender tone Natsha used toward her The
more emotional and ingratiating the expression of Natshas face became
the more serious and stern grew Snyas

Natsha said she you asked me not to speak to you and I havent
spoken but now you yourself have begun I dont trust him Natsha Why
this secrecy

Again again interrupted Natsha

Natsha I am afraid for you

Afraid of what

I am afraid youre going to your ruin said Snya resolutely and was
herself horrified at what she had said

Anger again showed in Natshas face

And Ill go to my ruin I will as soon as possible Its not your
business It wont be you but I wholl suffer Leave me alone leave
me alone I hate you

Natsha moaned Snya aghast

I hate you I hate you Youre my enemy forever And Natsha ran out
of the room

Natsha did not speak to Snya again and avoided her With the same
expression of agitated surprise and guilt she went about the house
taking up now one occupation now another and at once abandoning them

Hard as it was for Snya she watched her friend and did not let her out
of her sight

The day before the count was to return Snya noticed that Natsha sat
by the drawing room window all the morning as if expecting something and
that she made a sign to an officer who drove past whom Snya took to be
Anatole

Snya began watching her friend still more attentively and noticed that
at dinner and all that evening Natsha was in a strange and unnatural
state She answered questions at random began sentences she did not
finish and laughed at everything

After tea Snya noticed a housemaid at Natshas door timidly waiting to
let her pass She let the girl go in and then listening at the door
learned that another letter had been delivered

Then suddenly it became clear to Snya that Natsha had some dreadful
plan for that evening Snya knocked at her door Natsha did not let
her in

She will run away with him thought Snya She is capable of
anything There was something particularly pathetic and resolute in her
face today She cried as she said goodby to Uncle Snya remembered
Yes thats it she means to elope with him but what am I to do
thought she recalling all the signs that clearly indicated that Natsha
had some terrible intention The count is away What am I to do Write
to Kurgin demanding an explanation But what is there to oblige him to
reply Write to Pierre as Prince Andrew asked me to in case of some
misfortune But perhaps she really has already refused Bolknskishe
sent a letter to Princess Mary yesterday And Uncle is away To tell
Mrya Dmtrievna who had such faith in Natsha seemed to Snya terrible
Well anyway thought Snya as she stood in the dark passage now or
never I must prove that I remember the familys goodness to me and that
I love Nicholas Yes If I dont sleep for three nights Ill not leave
this passage and will hold her back by force and will and not let the
family be disgraced thought she





CHAPTER XVI

Anatole had lately moved to Dlokhovs The plan for Natalie Rostvas
abduction had been arranged and the preparations made by Dlokhov a few
days before and on the day that Snya after listening at Natshas
door resolved to safeguard her it was to have been put into execution
Natsha had promised to come out to Kurgin at the back porch at ten
that evening Kurgin was to put her into a troyka he would have ready
and to drive her forty miles to the village of Kamenka where an
unfrocked priest was in readiness to perform a marriage ceremony over
them At Kamenka a relay of horses was to wait which would take them to
the Warsaw highroad and from there they would hasten abroad with post
horses

Anatole had a passport an order for post horses ten thousand rubles he
had taken from his sister and another ten thousand borrowed with
Dlokhovs help

Two witnesses for the mock marriageKhvostikov a retired petty official
whom Dlokhov made use of in his gambling transactions and Makarin a
retired hussar a kindly weak fellow who had an unbounded affection for
Kurginwere sitting at tea in Dlokhovs front room

In his large study the walls of which were hung to the ceiling with
Persian rugs bearskins and weapons sat Dlokhov in a traveling cloak
and high boots at an open desk on which lay an abacus and some bundles
of paper money Anatole with uniform unbuttoned walked to and fro from
the room where the witnesses were sitting through the study to the room
behind where his French valet and others were packing the last of his
things Dlokhov was counting the money and noting something down

Well he said Khvostikov must have two thousand

Give it to him then said Anatole

Makarka their name for Makarin will go through fire and water for
you for nothing So here are our accounts all settled said Dlokhov
showing him the memorandum Is that right

Yes of course returned Anatole evidently not listening to Dlokhov
and looking straight before him with a smile that did not leave his
face

Dlokhov banged down the lid of his desk and turned to Anatole with an
ironic smile

Do you know Youd really better drop it all Theres still time

Fool retorted Anatole Dont talk nonsense If you only knew its
the devil knows what

No really give it up said Dlokhov I am speaking seriously Its
no joke this plot youve hatched

What teasing again Go to the devil Eh said Anatole making a
grimace Really its no time for your stupid jokes and he left the
room

Dlokhov smiled contemptuously and condescendingly when Anatole had gone
out

You wait a bit he called after him Im not joking Im talking
sense Come here come here

Anatole returned and looked at Dlokhov trying to give him his
attention and evidently submitting to him involuntarily

Now listen to me Im telling you this for the last time Why should I
joke about it Did I hinder you Who arranged everything for you Who
found the priest and got the passport Who raised the money I did it
all

Well thank you for it Do you think I am not grateful And Anatole
sighed and embraced Dlokhov

I helped you but all the same I must tell you the truth it is a
dangerous business and if you think about ita stupid business Well
youll carry her offall right Will they let it stop at that It will
come out that youre already married Why theyll have you in the
criminal court

Oh nonsense nonsense Anatole ejaculated and again made a grimace
Didnt I explain to you What And Anatole with the partiality dull
witted people have for any conclusion they have reached by their own
reasoning repeated the argument he had already put to Dlokhov a
hundred times Didnt I explain to you that I have come to this
conclusion if this marriage is invalid he went on crooking one
finger then I have nothing to answer for but if it is valid no
matter Abroad no one will know anything about it Isnt that so And
dont talk to me dont dont

Seriously youd better drop it Youll only get yourself into a mess

Go to the devil cried Anatole and clutching his hair left the room
but returned at once and dropped into an armchair in front of Dlokhov
with his feet turned under him Its the very devil What Feel how it
beats He took Dlokhovs hand and put it on his heart What a foot
my dear fellow What a glance A goddess he added in French What

Dlokhov with a cold smile and a gleam in his handsome insolent eyes
looked at himevidently wishing to get some more amusement out of him

Well and when the moneys gone what then

What then Eh repeated Anatole sincerely perplexed by a thought of
the future What then Then I dont know But why talk
nonsense He glanced at his watch Its time

Anatole went into the back room

Now then Nearly ready Youre dawdling he shouted to the servants

Dlokhov put away the money called a footman whom he ordered to bring
something for them to eat and drink before the journey and went into
the room where Khvostikov and Makarin were sitting

Anatole lay on the sofa in the study leaning on his elbow and smiling
pensively while his handsome lips muttered tenderly to himself

Come and eat something Have a drink Dlokhov shouted to him from the
other room

I dont want to answered Anatole continuing to smile

Come Balaga is here

Anatole rose and went into the dining room Balaga was a famous troyka
driver who had known Dlokhov and Anatole some six years and had given
them good service with his troykas More than once when Anatoles
regiment was stationed at Tver he had taken him from Tver in the
evening brought him to Moscow by daybreak and driven him back again
the next night More than once he had enabled Dlokhov to escape when
pursued More than once he had driven them through the town with gypsies
and ladykins as he called the cocottes More than once in their
service he had run over pedestrians and upset vehicles in the streets of
Moscow and had always been protected from the consequences by my
gentlemen as he called them He had ruined more than one horse in their
service More than once they had beaten him and more than once they had
made him drunk on champagne and Madeira which he loved and he knew
more than one thing about each of them which would long ago have sent an
ordinary man to Siberia They often called Balaga into their orgies and
made him drink and dance at the gypsies and more than one thousand
rubles of their money had passed through his hands In their service he
risked his skin and his life twenty times a year and in their service
had lost more horses than the money he had from them would buy But he
liked them liked that mad driving at twelve miles an hour liked
upsetting a driver or running down a pedestrian and flying at full
gallop through the Moscow streets He liked to hear those wild tipsy
shouts behind him Get on Get on when it was impossible to go any
faster He liked giving a painful lash on the neck to some peasant who
more dead than alive was already hurrying out of his way Real
gentlemen he considered them

Anatole and Dlokhov liked Balaga too for his masterly driving and
because he liked the things they liked With others Balaga bargained
charging twentyfive rubles for a two hours drive and rarely drove
himself generally letting his young men do so But with his gentlemen
he always drove himself and never demanded anything for his work Only a
couple of times a yearwhen he knew from their valets that they had
money in handhe would turn up of a morning quite sober and with a deep
bow would ask them to help him The gentlemen always made him sit down

Do help me out Theodore Ivanych sir or your excellency he would
say I am quite out of horses Let me have what you can to go to the
fair

And Anatole and Dlokhov when they had money would give him a thousand
or a couple of thousand rubles

Balaga was a fairhaired short and snubnosed peasant of about twenty
seven redfaced with a particularly red thick neck glittering little
eyes and a small beard He wore a fine darkblue silklined cloth
coat over a sheepskin

On entering the room now he crossed himself turning toward the front
corner of the room and went up to Dlokhov holding out a small black
hand

Theodore Ivanych he said bowing

How dyou do friend Well here he is

Good day your excellency he said again holding out his hand to
Anatole who had just come in

I say Balaga said Anatole putting his hands on the mans shoulders
do you care for me or not Eh Now do me a service What horses
have you come with Eh

As your messenger ordered your special beasts replied Balaga

Well listen Balaga Drive all three to death but get me there in
three hours Eh

When they are dead what shall I drive said Balaga with a wink

Mind Ill smash your face in Dont make jokes cried Anatole
suddenly rolling his eyes

Why joke said the driver laughing As if Id grudge my gentlemen
anything As fast as ever the horses can gallop so fast well go

Ah said Anatole Well sit down

Yes sit down said Dlokhov

Ill stand Theodore Ivanych

Sit down nonsense Have a drink said Anatole and filled a large
glass of Madeira for him

The drivers eyes sparkled at the sight of the wine After refusing it
for manners sake he drank it and wiped his mouth with a red silk
handkerchief he took out of his cap

And when are we to start your excellency

Well Anatole looked at his watch Well start at once Mind
Balaga Youll get there in time Eh

That depends on our luck in starting else why shouldnt we be there in
time replied Balaga Didnt we get you to Tver in seven hours I
think you remember that your excellency

Do you know one Christmas I drove from Tver said Anatole smilingly
at the recollection and turning to Makarin who gazed rapturously at him
with wideopen eyes Will you believe it Makarka it took ones breath
away the rate we flew We came across a train of loaded sleighs and
drove right over two of them Eh

Those were horses Balaga continued the tale That time Id harnessed
two young side horses with the bay in the shafts he went on turning
to Dlokhov Will you believe it Theodore Ivanych those animals flew
forty miles I couldnt hold them in my hands grew numb in the sharp
frost so that I threw down the reinsCatch hold yourself your
excellency says I and I just tumbled on the bottom of the sleigh and
sprawled there It wasnt a case of urging them on there was no holding
them in till we reached the place The devils took us there in three
hours Only the near one died of it





CHAPTER XVII

Anatole went out of the room and returned a few minutes later wearing a
fur coat girt with a silver belt and a sable cap jauntily set on one
side and very becoming to his handsome face Having looked in a mirror
and standing before Dlokhov in the same pose he had assumed before it
he lifted a glass of wine

Well goodby Theodore Thank you for everything and farewell said
Anatole Well comrades and friends he considered for a moment
of my youth farewell he said turning to Makarin and the others

Though they were all going with him Anatole evidently wished to make
something touching and solemn out of this address to his comrades He
spoke slowly in a loud voice and throwing out his chest slightly swayed
one leg

All take glasses you too Balaga Well comrades and friends of my
youth weve had our fling and lived and reveled Eh And now when
shall we meet again I am going abroad We have had a good timenow
farewell lads To our health Hurrah he cried and emptying his
glass flung it on the floor

To your health said Balaga who also emptied his glass and wiped his
mouth with his handkerchief

Makarin embraced Anatole with tears in his eyes

Ah Prince how sorry I am to part from you

Lets go Lets go cried Anatole

Balaga was about to leave the room

No stop said Anatole Shut the door we have first to sit down
Thats the way

They shut the door and all sat down

Now quick march lads said Anatole rising

Joseph his valet handed him his sabretache and saber and they all
went out into the vestibule

And wheres the fur cloak asked Dlokhov Hey Ignatka Go to
Matrena Matrevna and ask her for the sable cloak I have heard what
elopements are like continued Dlokhov with a wink Why shell rush
out more dead than alive just in the things she is wearing if you delay
at all therell be tears and Papa and Mamma and shes frozen in a
minute and must go backbut you wrap the fur cloak round her first thing
and carry her to the sleigh

The valet brought a womans foxlined cloak

Fool I told you the sable one Hey Matrena the sable he shouted so
that his voice rang far through the rooms

A handsome slim and palefaced gypsy girl with glittering black eyes
and curly blueblack hair wearing a red shawl ran out with a sable
mantle on her arm

Here I dont grudge ittake it she said evidently afraid of her
master and yet regretful of her cloak

Dlokhov without answering took the cloak threw it over Matrena and
wrapped her up in it

Thats the way said Dlokhov and then so and he turned the collar
up round her head leaving only a little of the face uncovered And
then so do you see and he pushed Anatoles head forward to meet the
gap left by the collar through which Matrenas brilliant smile was
seen

Well goodby Matrena said Anatole kissing her Ah my revels here
are over Remember me to Steshka There goodby Goodbye Matrena
wish me luck

Well Prince may God give you great luck said Matrena in her gypsy
accent

Two troykas were standing before the porch and two young drivers were
holding the horses Balaga took his seat in the front one and holding
his elbows high arranged the reins deliberately Anatole and Dlokhov
got in with him Makarin Khvostikov and a valet seated themselves in
the other sleigh

Well are you ready asked Balaga

Go he cried twisting the reins round his hands and the troyka tore
down the Nikitski Boulevard

Tproo Get out of the way Hi Tproo The shouting of Balaga and
of the sturdy young fellow seated on the box was all that could be
heard On the Arbat Square the troyka caught against a carriage
something cracked shouts were heard and the troyka flew along the
Arbat Street

After taking a turn along the Podnovinski Boulevard Balaga began to
rein in and turning back drew up at the crossing of the old Konyusheny
Street

The young fellow on the box jumped down to hold the horses and Anatole
and Dlokhov went along the pavement When they reached the gate
Dlokhov whistled The whistle was answered and a maidservant ran out

Come into the courtyard or youll be seen shell come out directly
said she

Dlokhov stayed by the gate Anatole followed the maid into the
courtyard turned the corner and ran up into the porch

He was met by Gabriel Mrya Dmtrievnas gigantic footman

Come to the mistress please said the footman in his deep bass
intercepting any retreat

To what Mistress Who are you asked Anatole in a breathless whisper

Kindly step in my orders are to bring you in

Kurgin Come back shouted Dlokhov Betrayed Back

Dlokhov after Anatole entered had remained at the wicket gate and was
struggling with the yard porter who was trying to lock it With a last
desperate effort Dlokhov pushed the porter aside and when Anatole ran
back seized him by the arm pulled him through the wicket and ran back
with him to the troyka





CHAPTER XVIII

Mrya Dmtrievna having found Snya weeping in the corridor made her
confess everything and intercepting the note to Natsha she read it and
went into Natshas room with it in her hand

You shameless goodfornothing said she I wont hear a word

Pushing back Natsha who looked at her with astonished but tearless
eyes she locked her in and having given orders to the yard porter to
admit the persons who would be coming that evening but not to let them
out again and having told the footman to bring them up to her she
seated herself in the drawing room to await the abductors

When Gabriel came to inform her that the men who had come had run away
again she rose frowning and clasping her hands behind her paced
through the rooms a long time considering what she should do Toward
midnight she went to Natshas room fingering the key in her pocket
Snya was sitting sobbing in the corridor Mrya Dmtrievna for Gods
sake let me in to her she pleaded but Mrya Dmtrievna unlocked the
door and went in without giving her an answer Disgusting
abominable In my house horrid girl hussy Im only sorry for her
father thought she trying to restrain her wrath Hard as it may be
Ill tell them all to hold their tongues and will hide it from the
count She entered the room with resolute steps Natsha lying on the
sofa her head hidden in her hands and she did not stir She was in
just the same position in which Mrya Dmtrievna had left her

A nice girl Very nice said Mrya Dmtrievna Arranging meetings
with lovers in my house Its no use pretending you listen when I speak
to you And Mrya Dmtrievna touched her arm Listen when I speak
Youve disgraced yourself like the lowest of hussies Id treat you
differently but Im sorry for your father so I will conceal it

Natsha did not change her position but her whole body heaved with
noiseless convulsive sobs which choked her Mrya Dmtrievna glanced
round at Snya and seated herself on the sofa beside Natsha

Its lucky for him that he escaped me but Ill find him she said in
her rough voice Do you hear what I am saying or not she added

She put her large hand under Natshas face and turned it toward her
Both Mrya Dmtrievna and Snya were amazed when they saw how Natsha
looked Her eyes were dry and glistening her lips compressed her
cheeks sunken

Let me be What is it to me I shall die she muttered
wrenching herself from Mrya Dmtrievnas hands with a vicious effort
and sinking down again into her former position

Natalie said Mrya Dmtrievna I wish for your good Lie still stay
like that then I wont touch you But listen I wont tell you how
guilty you are You know that yourself But when your father comes back
tomorrow what am I to tell him Eh

Again Natshas body shook with sobs

Suppose he finds out and your brother and your betrothed

I have no betrothed I have refused him cried Natsha

Thats all the same continued Mrya Dmtrievna If they hear of
this will they let it pass He your father I know him if he
challenges him to a duel will that be all right Eh

Oh let me be Why have you interfered at all Why Why Who asked you
to shouted Natsha raising herself on the sofa and looking
malignantly at Mrya Dmtrievna

But what did you want cried Mrya Dmtrievna growing angry again
Were you kept under lock and key Who hindered his coming to the house
Why carry you off as if you were some gypsy singing girl Well if he
had carried you off do you think they wouldnt have found him Your
father or brother or your betrothed And hes a scoundrel a
wretchthats a fact

He is better than any of you exclaimed Natsha getting up If you
hadnt interfered Oh my God What is it all What is it Snya
why Go away

ROGET'S THESAURUS
OF
ENGLISH WORDS AND PHRASES

Notes on the automatically-generated Index to Roget's Thesaurus,
1911 edition.

Introduction A true Roget's Thesaurus (as opposed to an
alphabetically-listed synonym dictionary) is composed of three parts:

- a hierarchical classification structure (hierarchy or "Synopsis of
  Categories");

- a body, which lists the Categories (whose titles are sometimes
referred to as "head words" or "headings"), under which are found the
groups of semantically- or conceptually-related words and phrases
(also called synonyms or entries);

- and an Index that lists the entries alphabetically (along with the
Category titles and numbers under which the entry may be found in the
body).

This document contains the complete Index to the 1911 (American)
edition. It was generated from the entries (synonyms, phrases and word
lists) contained in the Gutenburg/MICRA free E- text thesaurus 14a
(plain text version). It is larger than the original 1911 Roget's
Thesaurus Index, containing all text entries (i.e. excluding numbers,
special characters and parenthetical information) up to 25 characters
long (91,000+ entries).

Index Entries This Index lacks the intelligence found in the original
hand-edited Index, where common-sense aggregations occur. For example
A B C and A.B.C. are found under a single Index entry in the original
Index. Also, phrases are here listed alphabetically rather than
"semantically." For example, in the original Index under the Index
entry home there are phrases such as be at -, at - with, bring Đ to
("be at home," "at home with," " bring home to"). In this
automatically-generated Index be at home is instead listed after the
entry be at cross purposes with and before the entries be at home in,
and be at home with; while bring home to is listed after bring
i.e. none are listed under home.

This Index includes archaic and obsolete words; foreign terms; Latin
quotations; and many other such entries that the average
thesaurus-user would never need, and were not included in the original
Index.

Foreign characters such as umlaut, circumflex, grave or acute may be
found to encoded using ASCII characters e.g. flamb_ee, b=ete noire. A
look-up for these codes is not provided.

Pages: There are 565 pages in this document (including this page) in
four-column format (one column in the plain text file). The 1911
Roget's Thesaurus (large print edition) begins at page 351 and ends at
page 653 (302 pages) in four-column format.

Header Page: I have included the original Roget's header page to the
Index (with its explanatory note) for completeness. However the
information it gives is not accurate for this automatically- generated
Index i.e., for words or phrases that are both an Index entry and one
of the Category names ("headings") listed beneath it, the reference
number is not printed in bold-face type.

INDEX

N.B. The numbers refer to the headings under which the words or
phrases occur.  When the same word or phrase may be used in various
senses, several headings under which it, or its synonyms, will be
found, according to those meanings, are indicated by the words printed
in Italics.  These words in Italics are not intended to explain the
meaning of the word or phrase to which they are annexed, but only to
assist in the required reference.

When a number or word of reference is placed within parentheses, the
actual word or phrase will not be found under the heading referred to,
although it may sometimes be useful to consult the category thus
indicated.

When the word given in the Index is itself the title or heading of the
category, the number of reference is printed in bold-face type, thus:
abode 186.  (Note to readers utililizing the plain .txt file: the
